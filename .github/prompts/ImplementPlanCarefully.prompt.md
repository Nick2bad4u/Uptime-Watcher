Make sure to take extra care to fully analyze all code before making changes to understand the extent of your changes. Feel free to fix formatting issues with the (npm run lint) command.

Always follow datapaths of any code you change to understand the full affect of the code you're changing, what it does, and how the changes you make will affect it.
