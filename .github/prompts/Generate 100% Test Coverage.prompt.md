# Review all Coverage and Test Files

Use the commands "npm run test:coverage" and "npm run test:electron:coverage" and create testing for all files that do not have 100% branch coverage.
Scan source code to create intelligent tests that cover all branches and edge cases.
Ensure that all tests are comprehensive and cover all edge cases.
You can use as many requests and time as needed to achieve this goal.
You cannot skip any files, even if they are small or seem trivial.
You cannot stop until all files have 100% branch coverage.
You cannot stop even if it takes a long time to complete.
You should update the Memory MCP with all important information and insights gained during this process.

Requirements:

- Review coverage reports
- 100% branch coverage for all files
- Create tests for all files without 100% branch coverage until all files are covered 100%
