description: "Continue Addressing TODO List Items"
---

- This is a generic continuation prompt to pick up where you left off in the TODO list, you might have to adapt based on the current state of the TODO list.
- Start by reviewing the TODO.md file at the repository root to identify the current state of all pending tasks.
- Update current if any completed tasks have not yet been marked as done.
- Locate the next incomplete TODO item (those not marked as done or resolved).
- If you have any questions or need clarification on any TODO items, document them clearly for further review or stop and ask for assistance.
- For each incomplete TODO item, proceed systematically:

  - Review the context, problem description, and any relevant files mentioned.
  - Assess the current state and any blockers or dependencies.
  - Implement necessary changes, fixes, or features using available tools.
  - Test and validate the changes to ensure they resolve the issue without introducing new problems.
  - Mark the TODO item as complete with a clear summary of what was accomplished.
  - If new issues arise, document them and add follow-up TODOs as required.

- Continue iterating through the list, working on the next incomplete item after each one is resolved.
- Maintain clear documentation and update the TODO.md file throughout the process.
- Stop when you encounter a TODO item that requires external input, clarification, or cannot proceed due to blockers.
- If all TODO items are completed, ensure the TODO.md file reflects this status clearly.
- Review your work thoroughly to ensure all tasks are completed correctly and the codebase remains stable.
- After finishing the TODO list, take your time to review your work rigorously, especially any changes you made. Your solution must be perfect. If not, continue working on it.
- Always run linters, tests, and type checks after making changes to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
