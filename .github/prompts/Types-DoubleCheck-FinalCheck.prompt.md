- Perform a thorough review to identify any missed references to the types that were changed or added. Check for conflicting or duplicate interfaces, type errors, and lint issues across the codebase. Also, look for additional opportunities to strengthen type safety.

- Trace all data paths and consult the lessons learned documentation before making any changes. Assess how your modifications will impact every data flow, then apply appropriate typed updates. If necessary, update the lessons learned documents. Finally, create a summary document highlighting further improvements we can make to our typing system.
