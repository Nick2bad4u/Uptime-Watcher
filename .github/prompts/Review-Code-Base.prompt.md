# Deep Review Mode (Simplified)

Objective:
Perform an exhaustive, adversarial review of the entire repository to surface bugs, security issues, design flaws, risky assumptions, and improvement opportunities.

Scope:
- Include ALL: source, tests, scripts, build + CI/CD, infra-as-code, container specs, package manifests, lockfiles, env/example env, docs, schemas, migrations, seeds.
- Multi-package/service boundaries: analyze interactions.
- Generated/vendor code: note if skipped and why.
- No code modification—report only.

Analysis Dimensions:
1. Correctness & Logic: off-by-one, uninitialized, unreachable, dead code, incorrect conditionals.
2. API & Contracts: doc vs implementation drift, inconsistent payload shapes, validation gaps.
3. Error Handling & Resilience: swallowed errors, broad catches, missing retries/backoff, partial failure handling.
4. Security: injection (SQL/command/XSS/SSRF), CSRF, unsafe deserialization, insecure randomness, hardcoded secrets, weak crypto, path traversal, dependency CVEs.
5. AuthN / AuthZ: missing checks, privilege escalation, bypass vectors.
6. Data Integrity & Validation: trusting client input, race conditions, schema mismatch.
7. Concurrency & Parallelism: data races, unsafe shared state, async misuse, blocking calls on async paths.
8. Performance & Scalability: N+1 IO, sync IO in hot paths, quadratic loops, unbounded growth, inefficient serialization.
9. Memory & Resources: leaks, unreleased handles, large aggregations, circular refs.
10. Configuration & Environment: silent defaults, missing fallbacks, env-specific assumptions.
11. Build & Deployment: reproducibility, fragile scripts, unpinned tools, outdated images.
12. Dependency Health: outdated/unmaintained/deprecated/licensing risk hotspots.
13. Observability: inconsistent log levels, PII exposure, missing structured logs, absent metrics/tracing.
14. Testing Gaps: critical paths untested, flaky patterns, missing property/fuzz tests.
15. Data Models & Migrations: irreversible steps, no rollback, schema drift, missing indexes.
16. I18n & L10n: hardcoded strings, encoding assumptions.
17. Accessibility (UI): missing roles, keyboard traps, contrast issues.
18. Frontend Specific: XSS surfaces, unsafe DOM ops, state management pitfalls, layout shift, race conditions in fetching.
19. Cloud/Infra: permissive IAM, missing encryption, exposure, lack of limits.
20. Domain Rules: violated invariants inferred from naming/patterns.
21. Documentation Accuracy: outdated README, misleading comments/examples.
22. Adversarial & Edge Cases: malformed input, large sizes, concurrency bursts, clock skew, DST, locale changes, partial network failures, retries/replays, slow responses.
23. Supply Chain & CI/CD Security: unsigned artifacts, unpinned actions, script injection.
24. Creative Stress: mid-transaction crash scenarios, dependency behavior shifts, time-based anomalies, exotic encodings (emoji, RTL), fuzz candidates.

Output Structure:

## Executive Summary
- Overall risk posture
- Top 5–10 highest-impact findings (brief)
- Systemic patterns

## Findings
For each issue:
- ID: F-### (ordered by severity)
- Title
- Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational) + justification
- Category (dimension)
- Location (path + function/method + line range if feasible)
- Description (problem & impact)
- Evidence (concise snippet / pseudo)
- Exploit / Failure Scenario (if applicable)
- Remediation Recommendation (actionable)
- Suggested Tests (unit/integration/property/fuzz)
- Related Issues (pattern linkage)
- Confidence (High / Medium / Low) + rationale

## Dependency Risk Table
- name | version | issue (outdated / vuln / deprecated / license) | recommendation

## Architectural Concerns
- Cross-cutting risks, coupling, layering violations, SPOFs.

## Testing Gap Map
- Critical modules vs apparent coverage (estimate if metrics absent).

## Quick Wins
- Low effort / high value.

## Longer-Term Refactors
- Strategic, higher effort.

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Gaps, uncertainties, skipped areas (with reasons).

## Suggested Next Steps
- Week 1
- Sprint 1
- Quarter plan (prioritized)

Severity Guidance:
- Critical: Direct exploit / data loss / systemic outage.
- High: Likely failure or significant security weakness.
- Medium: Potential defect with moderate impact.
- Low: Minor issue / style / low risk.
- Informational: Observation / enhancement idea.

Adversarial / Edge Focus:
Consider partial writes, mid-crash rollback safety, reorderings, time anomalies (leap second, year changes), replay attacks, duplicate deliveries, encoding edge cases.

Fuzz Candidates (list examples):
- Input parsers
- Config loaders
- Filename/path handling
- IPC payload validation
- SQL query builders

Observability Checklist:
- Structured logging presence
- Log level consistency
- PII redaction
- Metrics/tracing hooks
- Correlation IDs

Confidence Handling:
State uncertainty explicitly; avoid overstating.

If Information Missing:
List blocking gaps (e.g., missing auth layer code) and their impact on confidence.

Constraints:
- Read-only analysis.
- Do not auto-fix code.
- Provide actionable, prioritized remediation.

Tooling (MCP Sequential Thinking - summarized):
- Parameter: available_mcp_tools (array)
- Parameter: thought (string)
- Parameter: next_thought_needed (boolean)
- Parameter: thought_number / total_thoughts (integers)
- Optional: is_revision, revises_thought, branching metadata
- Output: step_description, recommended_tools (with confidence), expected_outcome, next_step_conditions, progress metadata.

Mode Settings:
- Time: unlimited
- Compute: unlimited
- Thinking Mode: Super / Deep
- Goal: High-rigor, exhaustive reasoning.
