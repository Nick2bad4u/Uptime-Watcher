# This is a Dependabot configuration file for automating dependency updates.
# The configuration is set to version 2 of the Dependabot schema.
# It defines update settings for three package ecosystems:
# GitHub Actions, Bundler, and npm.
# Each ecosystem has its own update configuration, including:
# - The directory to scan for dependencies (root directory in this case).
# - The schedule for checking updates (daily).
# - Allowing both direct and indirect updates for all packages.
# - Grouping updates by ecosystem with specific patterns for version updates.
