- **Mitigation Steps:** Suggest actionable fixes or improvements.
- **Best Practices:** Recommend coding and architectural best practices for security.
- **Testing Recommendations:** Propose ways to test and verify security.

**Guidelines:**

- Reference specific lines, files, or patterns.
- Prioritize issues by severity.
- Use a constructive and educational tone.
