# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to run ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
# The workflow is triggered on push and pull request events to the "main" branch, as well as on a scheduled basis every Saturday at 12:25 PM UTC.
# It includes the following steps:
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the step-security/harden-runner action to enhance the security of the GitHub Actions runner.
# 2. Checkout code: Uses the actions/checkout action to check out the repository code.
# 3. Cache node modules: Uses the actions/cache action to cache the '.node_modules' directory to speed up workflow runs.
# 4. Install all required ESLint plugins: Installs ESLint, the Microsoft SARIF formatter for ESLint, and all required ESLint plugins and configs used in eslint.config.js in the . directory.
# 5. Run ESLint: Executes ESLint with the specified configuration and file extensions, outputting the results in SARIF format.
# 6. Upload analysis results to GitHub: Uses the github/codeql-action/upload-sarif action to upload the ESLint results to GitHub for analysis.
# 7. Upload ESLint SARIF as artifact: Uses the actions/upload-artifact action to upload the ESLint SARIF file as an artifact.
#
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns
# found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
