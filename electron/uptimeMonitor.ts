 * The original monolithic UptimeMonitor class has been refactored into a modular architecture:
 * - UptimeOrchestrator: Main orchestrator class (use this instead)
 * - SiteManager: Site CRUD operations and caching
 * - MonitorManager: Monitoring operations and scheduling
 * - DatabaseManager: Database operations, import/export, and initialization
 *
 * Import from: `import \{ UptimeOrchestrator \} from "./UptimeOrchestrator";`
