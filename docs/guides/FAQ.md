### How do I build from source?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/uptime-watcher.git
cd uptime-watcher

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Download SQLite WASM
npm run download-sqlite3-wasm

# Start development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build && npm run dist
```

### Can I run it on a server?

Uptime Watcher is designed as a desktop application. For server monitoring, consider:

- **Headless mode:** Planned for future releases
- **Alternative tools:** Nagios, Zabbix, or Prometheus for server environments

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

### Is my monitoring data secure?

Yes:

- **Local storage:** All data stays on your device
- **No telemetry:** The app doesn't send usage data anywhere
- **No accounts:** No registration or cloud services required
- **Open source:** Code is publicly auditable

### What network requests does the app make?

The app only makes HTTP/HTTPS requests to:

1. **Sites you're monitoring:** For uptime checks
2. **Update servers:** When checking for app updates (optional)

No other network requests are made.

### Can I use it offline?

Partial offline functionality:

- **View historical data:** ‚úÖ Available offline
- **Modify settings:** ‚úÖ Available offline
- **Add/edit sites:** ‚úÖ Available offline
- **Active monitoring:** ‚ùå Requires internet connection

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### The app won't start

Common solutions:

1. **Restart your computer** and try again
2. **Run as administrator** (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)
3. **Check antivirus software** - add app to exceptions
4. **Reinstall the application** with a fresh download

### Sites show as "Unknown" status

This usually indicates:

1. **Network connectivity issues:** Check your internet connection
2. **Firewall blocking:** Ensure the app can make outbound requests
3. **Invalid URL format:** URLs should include protocol (https://)
4. **Site blocking requests:** Some sites block automated requests

### High CPU usage

To reduce CPU usage:

1. **Increase check intervals:** Use 5+ minutes instead of 30 seconds
2. **Reduce monitored sites:** Remove unused or duplicate sites
3. **Close other applications:** Free up system resources
4. **Check for updates:** Newer versions may have performance improvements

### Database errors

If you see database errors:

1. **Restart the app** - often resolves temporary issues
2. **Check disk space** - ensure adequate free storage
3. **Reset database** - see [Troubleshooting Guide](Troubleshooting.md#database-issues)

## üì± Platform-Specific

### Windows

#### Windows Defender flags the app as suspicious

This is common with new Electron apps. The installer is not yet code-signed. You can:

1. Add an exception in Windows Defender
2. Download from official sources only
3. Build from source code if concerned

#### App doesn't start after Windows update

Try reinstalling the app or running Windows compatibility troubleshooter.

### macOS

#### "App can't be opened because it's from an unidentified developer"

Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper, or run:

```bash
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

#### Permission errors on macOS

The app may need permissions for:

- **Network access:** Usually granted automatically
- **Notifications:** Check System Preferences ‚Üí Notifications

### Linux

#### Missing dependencies error

Install required libraries:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 libxss1 libasound2

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install gtk3 libXScrnSaver alsa-lib

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gtk3 libXScrnSaver alsa-lib
```

#### AppImage won't run

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x Uptime-Watcher-*.AppImage
./Uptime-Watcher-*.AppImage
```

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Start small:** Begin with 5-10 critical sites
2. **Use appropriate intervals:** 5 minutes for most sites, 1 minute for critical services
3. **Group related sites:** Use descriptive names and organize logically
4. **Monitor from user perspective:** Use end-user URLs, not server endpoints

### Performance Optimization

1. **Adjust check intervals:** Longer intervals = less resource usage
2. **Monitor fewer sites:** Quality over quantity
3. **Close when not needed:** App continues monitoring in system tray
4. **Regular maintenance:** Periodically clean up old/unused sites

### Reliability Tips

1. **Test URLs first:** Verify sites are accessible before adding
2. **Use HTTPS when available:** More secure and often more reliable
3. **Monitor CDN endpoints:** Some sites use multiple endpoints
4. **Check during maintenance:** Temporarily disable monitoring during planned maintenance
