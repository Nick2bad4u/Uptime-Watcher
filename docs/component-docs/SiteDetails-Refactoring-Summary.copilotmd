# SiteDetails Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the monolithic `SiteDetails` component using the same composition approach used for the `SiteCard` component. This significantly improves maintainability, readability, and testability.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Custom Hook (`useSiteDetails`)
**File**: `src/hooks/useSiteDetails.ts`
- Extracts all business logic and state management from the component
- Manages site data, monitor selection, form state, and handlers
- Provides a clean interface similar to the `useSite` hook pattern
- Handles auto-refresh, check intervals, and site modifications

### 2. Component Composition
**Directory Structure**:
```
src/components/SiteDetails/
├── SiteDetails.tsx                 # Main refactored component
├── SiteDetailsHeader.tsx           # Header with site info and status
├── SiteDetailsNavigation.tsx       # Tab navigation and controls
├── ScreenshotThumbnail.tsx         # Website screenshot preview
├── tabs/
│   ├── OverviewTab.tsx            # Overview metrics and quick actions
│   ├── AnalyticsTab.tsx           # Charts and analytics
│   ├── HistoryTab.tsx             # Check history listing
│   ├── SettingsTab.tsx            # Site configuration
│   └── index.ts                   # Tab exports
├── index.ts                       # Main exports
└── SiteDetails.backup.tsx         # Original file backup
```

### 3. Component Breakdown

#### `SiteDetailsHeader`
- Displays site name, URL, and current status
- Includes screenshot thumbnail with hover preview
- Shows loading spinner during refresh

#### `SiteDetailsNavigation`
- Tab navigation (Overview, Analytics, History, Settings)
- Monitor type selector
- Check interval controls
- Start/Stop monitoring buttons
- Time range selector for analytics

#### `OverviewTab`
- Key metrics grid (Status, Uptime, Response Time, Total Checks)
- Performance overview (Fastest/Slowest responses)
- Quick actions (Remove site)

#### `AnalyticsTab`
- Availability summary with time range filtering
- Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Advanced metrics (MTTR, incident count)
- Interactive charts (Line, Doughnut, Bar)

#### `HistoryTab`
- Filterable check history (All, Up, Down)
- Configurable display limits
- Detailed check information with timestamps

#### `SettingsTab`
- Site name configuration
- Check interval settings
- Site information display
- Danger zone (site removal)

## Benefits

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Single responsibility principle for each component
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on individual features

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other contexts
- Easy to test individual pieces
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 3. **Performance**
- Better memoization opportunities
- Reduced re-renders for unchanged sections
- Smaller bundle chunks for code splitting

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Clearer file organization
- Easier to understand component hierarchy
- Better TypeScript inference and error messages

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- The main `SiteDetails` export maintains the same interface
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to parent components

### Testing Strategy
- Individual components can be unit tested separately
- The custom hook can be tested independently
- Integration tests verify the complete user flow

### Future Improvements
- Add loading states for individual tabs
- Implement component-level error boundaries
- Add virtualization for large history lists
- Consider lazy loading for heavy analytics components

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before Refactoring
- Single 1,389-line file with mixed concerns
- Complex state management spread throughout
- Difficult to test individual features
- High coupling between UI and business logic

### After Refactoring
- Clean separation of concerns across multiple focused files
- Centralized business logic in custom hook
- Easy to test and maintain individual components
- Low coupling with clear interfaces

## Usage Example

```tsx
// Same interface as before - no breaking changes
<SiteDetails site={site} onClose={onClose} />
```

The refactored component provides the same functionality with much better internal organization and maintainability.
