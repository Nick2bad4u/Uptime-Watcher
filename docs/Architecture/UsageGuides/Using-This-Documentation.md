# Using This Documentation

This guide describes how to navigate the architecture knowledge base effectively and locate the material relevant to your work.

## Audience Checklist

- **New contributors** should begin with the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to understand current constraints, then continue with the Development Patterns Guide for implementation expectations.
- **Feature owners** should review the ADRs that apply to their domain and validate that the referenced templates and patterns still apply before starting work.
- **Reviewers** can use the Compliance Checklists to confirm that submitted changes align with the layered architecture.

## Suggested Reading Path

1. **ADRs** – capture the authoritative decisions that inform code structure.
2. **Patterns** – show the practical application of each decision with rich examples.
3. **Templates** – provide copy-ready scaffolding when introducing new primitives.
4. **TSDoc Standards** – ensure new code remains well documented and searchable.

## Maintaining Alignment

- Synchronize changes between ADRs, patterns, and templates when a new architectural rule is introduced.
- Log deviations from the documented approach in the relevant ADR if temporary exceptions are necessary.
- Submit documentation updates alongside code changes to prevent drift between reference material and implementation.
