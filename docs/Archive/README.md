## üéØ Purpose of Archive

### Why These Documents Were Archived
1. **Historical Value**: Documents the evolution and migration process
2. **Reference Material**: Useful for understanding past decisions
3. **Learning Resource**: Contains lessons learned from implementations
4. **Decluttering**: Keeps main docs directory focused on current, actionable documentation

### When to Reference Archive
- **Understanding Migration History**: See type safety migration process
- **Learning from Past Issues**: Review lessons learned documents
- **Architectural Context**: Understand why certain decisions were made
- **Research**: Reference detailed analysis and review materials

## üìö Current Active Documentation

For current, actionable documentation, see the main docs directory:
- **[AI-CONTEXT.md](../AI-CONTEXT.md)** - AI assistant onboarding
- **[DEVELOPER-QUICK-START.md](../DEVELOPER-QUICK-START.md)** - Developer setup
- **[API-DOCUMENTATION.md](../API-DOCUMENTATION.md)** - API reference
- **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Debug guide
- **[Architecture/](../Architecture/)** - Current architecture documentation
- **[Guides/](../Guides/)** - Implementation guides

## üîÑ Archive Maintenance

### Guidelines
- **No Active Updates**: Archive documents should not be modified
- **Reference Only**: Use for historical context and learning
- **Organized Structure**: Maintain clear categorization
- **Linked from Current Docs**: Reference when providing context

### Future Archival Process
When new documents become obsolete:
1. **Evaluate Relevance**: Is the document still current?
2. **Categorize**: Determine appropriate archive subdirectory
3. **Update Links**: Ensure no broken links in active documentation
4. **Update This Index**: Document what was archived and why

üí° **Note**: These archived documents represent the extensive analysis and implementation work that led to the current sophisticated architecture of Uptime Watcher. They serve as valuable historical context and learning material.
