## Claims Analysis

### Claim 1: Missing await on setInternal

**Status:** ❌ **FALSE POSITIVE**  
**Description:** "The call to repositories.settings.setInternal is not awaited, but the method signature for setInternal in the repository pattern should be async."

**Analysis:** Repository internal methods are designed to be synchronous and work within transaction context. The `setInternal` method returns `void`, not `Promise<void>`, making it a synchronous operation.

**Action:** No change needed - this is the correct usage pattern.

### Claim 2: Missing await on pruneAllHistoryInternal

**Status:** ❌ **FALSE POSITIVE**  
**Description:** "The call to repositories.history.pruneAllHistoryInternal is not awaited, but the repository pattern expects async mutation methods."

**Analysis:** Like `setInternal`, the `pruneAllHistoryInternal` method is synchronous and designed to work within transaction context.

**Action:** No change needed - this is the correct usage pattern.

### Claim 3: Transaction function not marked as async

**Status:** ❌ **FALSE POSITIVE**  
**Description:** "The function passed to executeTransaction is not marked as async, but it contains calls that should be awaited."

**Analysis:** Since the internal methods are synchronous, the transaction function doesn't need to be async. The current implementation is correct.

**Action:** No change needed.

### Claim 4: Missing documentation for minimum limit logic

**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY FIXED**  
**Description:** "The logic for enforcing a minimum limit of 10 is not documented in the TSDoc."

**Analysis:** This was already addressed in previous fixes with detailed limit behavior documentation.

**Action:** No additional changes needed.

### Claim 5: Missing documentation for setHistoryLimit callback

**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The setHistoryLimit callback parameter in SetHistoryLimitParams is not documented with its expected side effects."

**Analysis:** The callback documentation could be more detailed about its purpose and side effects.

**Action:** Enhance TSDoc for the callback parameter.

## Implementation Plan

1. Enhance documentation for the setHistoryLimit callback parameter
