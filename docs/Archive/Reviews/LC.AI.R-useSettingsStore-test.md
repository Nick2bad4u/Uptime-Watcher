**File:** `src/test/stores/settings/useSettingsStore.additional.test.ts`  
**Line:** 6:22-6:25  
**Issue:** Imported binding 'act' is not used  
**Category:** Code Smell  
**Severity:** Minor

## Analysis

### Context

The issue reported an unused import of the `act` utility from React Testing Library on line 6:22-6:25.

### Assessment

**VERDICT: FALSE POSITIVE / ALREADY RESOLVED**

After examining the current file, this issue is not present for the following reasons:

1. **No act Import Found**: The file does not contain any import of `act` from `@testing-library/react`
2. **Current Imports**: The file only imports `renderHook` from testing library
3. **File Content**: The entire file was reviewed and no unused `act` import exists

### Current File State

The file currently imports:

```typescript
import { renderHook } from "@testing-library/react";
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from "vitest";
```

No `act` import is present, so there's no unused import to remove.

### Possible Explanations

1. **Already Fixed**: The issue may have been resolved in a previous commit
2. **Outdated Report**: The issue report may be from an older version of the file
3. **False Positive**: The analysis tool may have incorrectly identified an issue

### Recommendation

**NO ACTION REQUIRED** - The reported issue is not present in the current version of the file.
