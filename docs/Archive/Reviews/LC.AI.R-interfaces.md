# Low Confidence AI Claims Review - interfaces.ts

**Review Date:** July 24, 2025

## Claims Analysis

### Claim 1: Stack overwriting in SiteLoadingError

**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "Overwriting this.stack with cause.stack in SiteLoadingError may lose the original error context. Consider appending the cause's stack instead of replacing it to preserve the full error trace."

**Analysis:** The current implementation `this.stack = cause.stack` completely replaces the error stack, losing the original stack trace. This makes debugging harder as the point where the SiteLoadingError was created is lost.

**Action:** Modify to preserve both stack traces by appending the cause stack.

### Claim 2: Missing TSDoc for SiteLoadingError constructor

**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The constructor for SiteLoadingError does not have a TSDoc comment."

**Analysis:** The class has no constructor documentation, which doesn't follow project TSDoc standards.

**Action:** Add comprehensive TSDoc for the constructor.

### Claim 3: Missing TSDoc for SiteNotFoundError constructor

**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The constructor for SiteNotFoundError lacks a TSDoc comment."

**Analysis:** Similar to SiteLoadingError, this class lacks proper documentation.

**Action:** Add TSDoc for the constructor.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix stack trace preservation in SiteLoadingError

- Append cause stack instead of overwriting
- Preserve original error creation context

### 2. Add comprehensive TSDoc documentation

- Document both error class constructors
- Follow project TSDoc standards
