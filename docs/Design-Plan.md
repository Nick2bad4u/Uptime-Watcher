ðŸ›  App Overview: "Uptime Watcher" An Electron app to monitor the uptime status of a list of user-defined websites, displaying live status updates, response times, and historical data.

1. Tech Stack Frontend: React (with Vite for bundling), Tailwind CSS

State Management: Zustand (lightweight and React-friendly)

Electron: Electron Forge or Electron Builder for scaffolding & packaging

Backend/API: Node.js with Axios for periodic HTTP checks

Database: SQLite (using better-sqlite3-wasm.wasm)

IPC Layer: Electron's ipcMain/ipcRenderer bridge for background checks

Optional: Chart.js or Recharts for plotting status over time

1. App Architecture Main Process (Electron):

Manages app lifecycle

Spawns periodic background uptime checks via Node.js

Renderer Process (React UI):

Displays current status, logs, charts

Interfaces with the state store (Zustand)

Communicates with main via IPC for updates

Worker Layer:

Scheduled pings using Axios (or Node HTTP lib)

Aggregates results and sends events back to renderer

1. Zustand Store Example ts import { create } from 'zustand'

const useStore = create(set => ({ sites: [],

addSite: site => set(state => ({ sites: [...state.sites, { ...site, status: 'pending', history: [] }] })),

updateSiteStatus: (url, status, responseTime) => set(state => ({ sites: state.sites.map(site => site.url === url ? { ...site, status, history: [...site.history, { timestamp: Date.now(), status, responseTime }] } : site ) })) })) 4\. Core Features Add/Remove Sites to monitor

Live Status Updates (green = OK, red = down)

Ping Frequency Selector

Response Time Graphs

Persisted History in local DB

Notifications on status changes (via Electron Notification API)

Auto-start on Boot (if enabled)

1. Design Considerations Efficient polling via setInterval or background cron-style tasks

Throttle requests for large site lists to avoid overwhelming bandwidth

Graceful error handling (timeouts, 500s, DNS issues)

Dark/light themes, accessibility, and responsive layout
