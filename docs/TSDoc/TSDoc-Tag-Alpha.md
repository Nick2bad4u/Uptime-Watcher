## Suggested meaning

Designates that an API item's release stage is "alpha". It is intended to be used by
third-party developers eventually, but has not yet been released. The tooling may trim the declaration from
a public release.

## Example

```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
 /**
  * The title of the book.
  * @alpha
  */
 public get title(): string;

 /**
  * The author of the book.
  */
 public get author(): string;
}
```

In this example, `Book.author` inherits its `@public` designation from the containing class,
whereas `Book.title` is marked as "alpha".
