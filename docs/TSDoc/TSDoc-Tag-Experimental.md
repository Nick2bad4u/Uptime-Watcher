## Suggested meaning

Same semantics as `@beta`, but used by tools that don't support an `@alpha` release stage.

## Example

```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 *
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
 /**
  * The title of the book.
  *
  * @experimental
  */
 public get title(): string;

 /**
  * The author of the book.
  */
 public get author(): string;
}
```

In this example, `Book.author` inherits its `@public` designation from the containing class,
whereas `Book.title` is marked as "experimental".
