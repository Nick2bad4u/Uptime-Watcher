# Interactive Architecture Charts

This section contains the Mermaid diagrams used on the documentation site.

These pages are authored in the repository under `docs/InteractiveCharts/` and are **copied into the Docusaurus docs output** via the TypeDoc `projectDocuments` pipeline, so they appear alongside the generated API docs.
