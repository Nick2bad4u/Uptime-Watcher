### ✨ Features

- ✨ [feat] Centralize monitor defaults and improve identifier display

- Centralizes default configuration values (timeouts, intervals, retry/backoff, history limits) into shared constants for consistency across backend and frontend.
- Updates monitor creation and settings logic to use these constants, ensuring unified and explicit default values.
- Refactors identifier display logic in the settings UI to show human-friendly labels and values based on monitor type (URL for HTTP, host:port for port monitors).
- Simplifies retry/backoff logic and ensures exponential backoff is consistently applied using constants.
- Cleans up and reorders store update functions for better maintainability.
- Removes redundant inline default values, relying on shared configuration.
- Fixes minor style and type issues for improved code clarity. [`(b6134be)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/b6134be75a6250204c9cc3c9f5fb4340231ded0e)

- ✨ [feat] Add per-monitor retry attempts with UI and persistence

- Introduces configurable retry attempts for individual monitors, allowing fine-grained control over failure detection sensitivity.
- Updates backend, database schema, and repository logic to store and process retry attempts per monitor.
- Refactors monitoring logic to use per-monitor retry and timeout, applying exponential backoff between attempts for reliability.
- Enhances UI: adds retry attempts configuration to site details, calculates max check duration, and removes global maxRetries from settings and docs.
- Sets default check interval to 5 minutes, removes auto-refresh, and improves advanced error/status handling for HTTP and port monitors.
- Cleans up related documentation and code for consistency.
