### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Modularizes backend architecture and optimizes sync

- Refactors backend codebase to a fully modular service/repository architecture, mirroring frontend patterns for maintainability and testability

  - Extracts all database, monitoring, notification, updater, window, and IPC logic into dedicated services and repositories with clear separation of concerns
  - Removes monolithic logic from main process entry point, delegating orchestration to an application service
  - Centralizes logging and error handling, ensuring consistent and robust diagnostics across all domains

- Optimizes frontend-backend synchronization for real-time UI updates

  - Implements smart incremental site updates using status event payloads, replacing inefficient full-database fetches on every monitor check
  - Achieves instant UI responsiveness and drastically reduces backend query load, supporting scalability for large site counts
  - Adds fallback to full sync for edge cases and error scenarios, ensuring reliability

- Fixes duplicate log entries and standardizes logging behaviors throughout the app, including React component event deduplication

- Enhances code quality and maintainability:

  - Cleans dead code, unused imports, and applies rigorous lint/formatting standards
  - Improves type safety, validation, and error resilience in both backend and frontend integration points

- Updates documentation and configuration to reflect new architecture and performance improvements

- Addresses real-time update bug for history and metrics in UI, and ensures all site/monitor changes are reflected instantly

- [dependency] Updates relevant dependencies for compatibility and development experience

### ÔøΩ Documentation

- üìù [docs] Add comprehensive codebase documentation and cleanup

- Adds detailed JSDoc-style documentation to all major modules, React components, hooks, and utility functions for improved maintainability and onboarding
- Refactors and enhances all documentation files, including README, guides, and API references, for improved clarity, navigation, and cross-linking
- Updates and reorganizes documentation structure to highlight core, API, user, and component docs with navigation improvements
- Removes a large third-party validator library doc, focusing documentation on project-relevant content
- Cleans up, annotates, and standardizes code comments and export barrels across backend and frontend for better code understanding
- Improves markdownlint and commitlint configs for more consistent documentation and commit practices
- Updates security policy and related docs to accurately reflect project naming and dependencies

Aims to make the codebase significantly easier to navigate and contribute to, while raising the bar for documentation quality. [`(28d3918)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/28d3918a0786eaf7e0e8a7953ce6a674c22b253e)
