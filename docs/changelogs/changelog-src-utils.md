### ‚ú® Features

- ‚ú® [feat] Add Electron main process, IPC, and uptime monitor backend

Introduces a comprehensive Electron backend, including the main process logic, IPC handlers, and an uptime monitoring engine with persistent SQLite storage.

Enables site and monitor management, status updates, per-site monitoring controls, and direct database backup/export/import via Electron APIs. Integrates auto-update support and notification handling for monitor status changes.

Adjusts ignore and VS Code settings to allow tracking of built Electron output, and improves file/folder exclusions for better workspace usability.

Lays the technical foundation for reliable uptime tracking, flexible data persistence, and robust desktop application functionality. [`(4e94c98)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/4e94c988797316fc0ae86fcab01142c2f3266c04)
