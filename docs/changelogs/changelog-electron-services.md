### ‚ú® Features

- ‚ú® [feat] Centralize monitor defaults and improve identifier display

- Centralizes default configuration values (timeouts, intervals, retry/backoff, history limits) into shared constants for consistency across backend and frontend.
- Updates monitor creation and settings logic to use these constants, ensuring unified and explicit default values.
- Refactors identifier display logic in the settings UI to show human-friendly labels and values based on monitor type (URL for HTTP, host:port for port monitors).
- Simplifies retry/backoff logic and ensures exponential backoff is consistently applied using constants.
- Cleans up and reorders store update functions for better maintainability.
- Removes redundant inline default values, relying on shared configuration.
- Fixes minor style and type issues for improved code clarity. [`(b6134be)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/b6134be75a6250204c9cc3c9f5fb4340231ded0e)

- ‚ú® [feat] Add per-monitor retry attempts with UI and persistence

- Introduces configurable retry attempts for individual monitors, allowing fine-grained control over failure detection sensitivity.
- Updates backend, database schema, and repository logic to store and process retry attempts per monitor.
- Refactors monitoring logic to use per-monitor retry and timeout, applying exponential backoff between attempts for reliability.
- Enhances UI: adds retry attempts configuration to site details, calculates max check duration, and removes global maxRetries from settings and docs.
- Sets default check interval to 5 minutes, removes auto-refresh, and improves advanced error/status handling for HTTP and port monitors.
- Cleans up related documentation and code for consistency.

Relates to #213 [`(a59c50d)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/a59c50d3c0e0e5196792b4e927a9a4db4781e914)

- ‚ú® [feat] Add per-monitor request timeout configuration

- Enables setting custom request timeouts for individual monitors, overriding the global/default timeout value
- Updates backend schema, frontend UI, and business logic to support per-monitor timeout input, persistence, and usage during monitoring
- Removes deprecated global timeout setting from app settings, making timeout a monitor-specific property for improved flexibility
- Improves user control over monitoring behavior, especially for sites or ports with varying response expectations [`(47f479b)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/47f479b1802ff2ed39a27956ab8a69e834b2fd8b)

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Use dedicated Axios instance and improve error handling

- Switches to a dedicated Axios instance with configurable defaults to improve code maintainability and reduce duplication
- Centralizes and simplifies error handling for HTTP monitoring, offering clearer distinctions between network errors, timeouts, and HTTP status responses
- Updates config logic to ensure Axios instance stays in sync with runtime changes
- Adds comprehensive documentation for Axios usage in the project

Enhances reliability and clarity of HTTP monitoring while making future maintenance easier. [`(66b2201)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/66b22010811825a82207cc6e4f5ab87a2390ba5d)

## [3.4.0] - 2025-06-28

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Modularizes backend architecture and optimizes sync

- Refactors backend codebase to a fully modular service/repository architecture, mirroring frontend patterns for maintainability and testability

  - Extracts all database, monitoring, notification, updater, window, and IPC logic into dedicated services and repositories with clear separation of concerns
  - Removes monolithic logic from main process entry point, delegating orchestration to an application service
  - Centralizes logging and error handling, ensuring consistent and robust diagnostics across all domains

- Optimizes frontend-backend synchronization for real-time UI updates

  - Implements smart incremental site updates using status event payloads, replacing inefficient full-database fetches on every monitor check
  - Achieves instant UI responsiveness and drastically reduces backend query load, supporting scalability for large site counts
  - Adds fallback to full sync for edge cases and error scenarios, ensuring reliability

- Fixes duplicate log entries and standardizes logging behaviors throughout the app, including React component event deduplication

- Enhances code quality and maintainability:

  - Cleans dead code, unused imports, and applies rigorous lint/formatting standards
  - Improves type safety, validation, and error resilience in both backend and frontend integration points

- Updates documentation and configuration to reflect new architecture and performance improvements

- Addresses real-time update bug for history and metrics in UI, and ensures all site/monitor changes are reflected instantly

- [dependency] Updates relevant dependencies for compatibility and development experience

Relates to performance, maintainability, and real-time UX improvements [`(750de8e)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/750de8e4750000c9898ce23429cf32f6ed31aa50)

### ÔøΩ Documentation

- üìù [docs] Add comprehensive codebase documentation and cleanup

- Adds detailed JSDoc-style documentation to all major modules, React components, hooks, and utility functions for improved maintainability and onboarding
- Refactors and enhances all documentation files, including README, guides, and API references, for improved clarity, navigation, and cross-linking
- Updates and reorganizes documentation structure to highlight core, API, user, and component docs with navigation improvements
- Removes a large third-party validator library doc, focusing documentation on project-relevant content
- Cleans up, annotates, and standardizes code comments and export barrels across backend and frontend for better code understanding
- Improves markdownlint and commitlint configs for more consistent documentation and commit practices
- Updates security policy and related docs to accurately reflect project naming and dependencies

Aims to make the codebase significantly easier to navigate and contribute to, while raising the bar for documentation quality. [`(28d3918)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/28d3918a0786eaf7e0e8a7953ce6a674c22b253e)

### ‚ö° Performance

- ‚ö° [perf] Make debug logging conditional on development mode

- Reduces log volume and noise in production by wrapping all non-essential debug and verbose logs in a development mode condition across backend services and frontend state management.
- Maintains always-on logging for errors, warnings, and critical state changes, ensuring production logs focus on actionable information.
- Improves log clarity, performance, and maintainability while preserving full debug detail for development and troubleshooting.
- Addresses prior issues with log spam from routine operations (IPC, monitor checks, database CRUD) and ensures cleaner log files in production environments. [`(9e0e7b1)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/9e0e7b1f59c71d13abd1dca76bd7d0040227bcc3)
