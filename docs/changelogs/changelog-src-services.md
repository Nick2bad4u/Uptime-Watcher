### ‚ú® Features

- ‚ú® [feat] Add Electron main process, IPC, and uptime monitor backend

Introduces a comprehensive Electron backend, including the main process logic, IPC handlers, and an uptime monitoring engine with persistent SQLite storage.

Enables site and monitor management, status updates, per-site monitoring controls, and direct database backup/export/import via Electron APIs. Integrates auto-update support and notification handling for monitor status changes.

Adjusts ignore and VS Code settings to allow tracking of built Electron output, and improves file/folder exclusions for better workspace usability.

Lays the technical foundation for reliable uptime tracking, flexible data persistence, and robust desktop application functionality. [`(4e94c98)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/4e94c988797316fc0ae86fcab01142c2f3266c04)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security

- Improves type safety and updates dependencies

Switches many uses of 'any' to more precise types for site data, status, and chart props, enhancing type safety and maintainability. Updates several dependencies and devDependencies to newer versions for better compatibility and security. Cleans up some component props and utility functions for improved clarity and reliability. [`(65ccbe3)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/65ccbe3f372f8d30ad303348869c92e1adc963d1)

### üíº Other

- Refactor site identifier usage across components and services

- Updated SiteDetails component to use 'identifier' instead of 'id' for site references.
- Modified SiteList to use 'identifier' as the key for SiteCard.
- Changed logger service to log site events using 'identifier'.
- Adjusted store actions and state management to handle 'identifier' instead of 'url' or 'id'.
- Updated types to reflect the new 'identifier' field in Site and Monitor interfaces.
- Enhanced error handling and validation for site and monitor operations.
- Updated TypeScript configuration to include vite.config.ts for better type checking. [`(fabc009)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/fabc009ff629d95a1d998806db89c48624a28452)

- Refactor code for improved readability and consistency

- Cleaned up formatting and spacing in SiteDetails component for better readability.
- Consolidated memoization hooks in SiteDetails for line and bar chart options.
- Streamlined logger service for consistent logging format and improved clarity.
- Enhanced theme component styles for better maintainability.
- Updated constants for consistent spacing and formatting.
- Refactored useSiteAnalytics hook for clarity and performance.
- Improved time formatting utility functions for consistency.
- Removed unnecessary whitespace and comments in various files. [`(6e75286)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/6e75286ce8d9f7eccf287f3dbfb5cbb17c19be20)

- Migrates to structured logging using electron-log

Replaces all console-based statements with a centralized, production-ready logging approach powered by electron-log. Introduces a shared logging service for both main and renderer processes, providing contextual log levels, error stack capture, and log rotation. Enhances traceability of site operations, user actions, settings changes, and application events, supporting easier debugging and future log analytics. Updates Flatpak and build configs for new log file paths and improves package metadata for distribution.

See Logging-Migration-Summary.md for migration details. [`(deab1aa)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/deab1aaa57f205516f8658816b8f53715b0c4677)

- Refactors analytics and chart config for maintainability

Centralizes chart configuration and site analytics logic into
dedicated, reusable services and hooks, reducing code duplication
and improving type safety. Introduces comprehensive constants
management for easier global configuration and future extensibility.
Enhances performance through memoization and clarifies application
structure for easier future development and testing. [`(78dc5b9)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/78dc5b9bbd99e23ca0fd5869192050b09ecf239f)

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Modularize and streamline site details UI

- Splits a large, monolithic site details component into modular, focused subcomponents for header, navigation, and tab content, improving readability and maintainability
- Introduces a custom hook to encapsulate site details state and logic, reducing prop drilling and duplication
- Moves tab content (overview, analytics, history, settings) to dedicated files with improved cohesion and separation of concerns
- Removes inline debug code and outdated comments for cleaner production code
- Ensures all user actions (tab changes, filter changes, key settings) are logged for better analytics and traceability
- Enhances code organization and paves way for easier future enhancements and testing [`(0c4b982)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/0c4b982d131386cbdaabda115efd6f4c0d8a6ff6)

### ÔøΩ Documentation

- üìù [docs] Add comprehensive codebase documentation and cleanup

- Adds detailed JSDoc-style documentation to all major modules, React components, hooks, and utility functions for improved maintainability and onboarding
- Refactors and enhances all documentation files, including README, guides, and API references, for improved clarity, navigation, and cross-linking
- Updates and reorganizes documentation structure to highlight core, API, user, and component docs with navigation improvements
- Removes a large third-party validator library doc, focusing documentation on project-relevant content
- Cleans up, annotates, and standardizes code comments and export barrels across backend and frontend for better code understanding
- Improves markdownlint and commitlint configs for more consistent documentation and commit practices
