Defined in: [electron/services/database/utils/databaseSchema.ts:173](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/blob/8a1973382d5fe14c52996ecda381894eb7ecd4a6/electron/services/database/utils/databaseSchema.ts#L173)

Sets up the monitor type validation framework for the database.

## Returns

`void`

void

## Remarks

Integrates with [getRegisteredMonitorTypes](../../../../monitoring/MonitorTypeRegistry/functions/getRegisteredMonitorTypes.md) to provide runtime validation of monitor types. Intended to set up database-level constraints and validation triggers to ensure data integrity for monitor type fields. Currently logs the available types and prepares for future enhancements.

## Throws

When validation setup fails. Errors are logged but not re-thrown, as this is a non-critical enhancement.
