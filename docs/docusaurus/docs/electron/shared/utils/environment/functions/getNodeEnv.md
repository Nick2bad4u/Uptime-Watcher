# Function: getNodeEnv()

> **getNodeEnv**(): `string`

Defined in: [shared/utils/environment.ts:70](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/blob/8a1973382d5fe14c52996ecda381894eb7ecd4a6/shared/utils/environment.ts#L70)

Get the current NODE_ENV value safely.
Safe alternative to direct process.env.NODE_ENV access.

## Returns

`string`

The NODE_ENV value or 'development' as fallback

## Remarks

Returns 'development' as fallback for safer development workflows and testing.
This assumes development mode when environment is unspecified, which is
appropriate for development tools and debugging features. Use getEnvironment()
if you need to detect truly unspecified environments.

## Example

```typescript
const env = getNodeEnv();
logger.debug("Current environment:", env);
```
