Defined in: [electron/services/database/utils/databaseSchema.ts:215](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/blob/main/electron/services/database/utils/databaseSchema.ts#L215)

Sets up the monitor type validation framework for the database.

## Returns

`void`

Void

## Remarks

Integrates with [getRegisteredMonitorTypes](../../../../monitoring/MonitorTypeRegistry/functions/getRegisteredMonitorTypes.md) to provide runtime
validation of monitor types. Intended to set up database-level constraints
and validation triggers to ensure data integrity for monitor type fields.
Currently logs the available types and prepares for future enhancements.

## Throws

When validation setup fails. Errors are logged but not re-thrown, as
  this is a non-critical enhancement.
