# Function: isDevelopment()

> **isDevelopment**(): `boolean`

Defined in: [shared/utils/environment.ts:124](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/blob/main/shared/utils/environment.ts#L124)

Check if running in development mode. Safe alternative to direct
process.env.NODE_ENV access.

## Returns

`boolean`

True if in development mode

## Remarks

Uses strict equality check against 'development' string. Only recognizes the
standard NODE_ENV value 'development' - variants like 'dev' are not
supported. This ensures consistent behavior across the application.

## Example

```typescript
if (isDevelopment()) {
    console.log("Debug information");
}
```
