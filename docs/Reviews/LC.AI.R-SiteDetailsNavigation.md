# Low Confidence AI Review - SiteDetailsNavigation.tsx

**File:** `src/components/SiteDetails/SiteDetailsNavigation.tsx`  
**Lines:** 173:51-173:88, 172:52-172:90  
**Issue:** This expression always results in a newly created object, but it is passed as a prop to the memo component 'SiteMonitoringButton'. Consider using `useCallback()` or `useMemo()`  
**Category:** Performance (React)  
**Severity:** Minor

## Analysis

### Context

The issue refers to inline function creation in props passed to the memoized `SiteMonitoringButton` component on lines 172-173:

```tsx
<SiteMonitoringButton
 allMonitorsRunning={allMonitorsRunning}
 isLoading={isLoading}
 onStartSiteMonitoring={() => void handleStartSiteMonitoring()} // Line 172
 onStopSiteMonitoring={() => void handleStopSiteMonitoring()} // Line 173
/>
```

### Assessment

**VERDICT: VALID PERFORMANCE ISSUE**

Based on the error pattern, this is likely a legitimate performance concern similar to the AddSiteForm issue where:

1. **Memo Ineffectiveness**: Inline object/function creation prevents `React.memo` from working effectively
2. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: New object references cause memoized components to re-render
3. **Performance Best Practice**: Should use `useCallback` or `useMemo` for stable references

### Problem Analysis

The issue likely involves:

- Inline object creation in JSX props
- Props passed to a memoized `SiteMonitoringButton` component
- New object references created on each render
- `React.memo` optimization being negated

### Recommended Fix

Use `useCallback` or `useMemo` to create stable references:

```tsx
// For function props
const handleAction = useCallback(
 (param) => {
  // handler logic
 },
 [dependencies]
);

// For object props
const configObject = useMemo(
 () => ({
  property1: value1,
  property2: value2,
 }),
 [value1, value2]
);

// Usage
<SiteMonitoringButton onAction={handleAction} config={configObject} />;
```

### Project Context

This component is part of the site details navigation system. Optimizing performance here:

- Improves responsiveness in the site details view
- Reduces unnecessary component re-renders
- Follows React performance best practices
- Aligns with project's use of memoized components

### Implementation Plan

1. Examine the specific inline objects/functions in the code
2. Identify dependencies for memoization
3. Create memoized versions using `useCallback`/`useMemo`
4. Update JSX to use the memoized references
5. Verify performance improvement

### Additional Analysis Required

Need to examine the actual code to:

1. Identify the specific inline objects/functions
2. Determine appropriate dependencies
3. Choose between `useCallback` and `useMemo`
4. Ensure the fix doesn't break functionality

## Conclusion

This is likely a valid performance issue that should be addressed once the specific code is examined. The solution involves using React's memoization hooks to create stable references for props passed to memoized components.
