# Low Confidence AI Claims Review - databaseInitializer.ts

**File:** `electron/utils/database/databaseInitializer.ts`  
**Review Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Reviewer:** AI Agent

## Claims Analysis

### Claim 1: Missing await on databaseService.initialize()

**Status:** ❌ **FALSE POSITIVE**  
**Description:** "databaseService.initialize(); is called without await, but the method is not async and returns the database instance. If initialization is synchronous, this is fine, but if it ever becomes async, this will break. Confirm that initialization is always synchronous."

**Analysis:** After examining the DatabaseService.initialize() method, it is indeed synchronous and returns void, not a Promise. No await is needed.

**Action:** No change needed.

### Claim 2: Error handling policy conflict

**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The comment says not to re-throw the error and to let the event system handle it, but project guidelines require errors to be re-thrown after logging. This should be discussed and aligned with the error handling policy."

**Analysis:** The comment on line 23 conflicts with project guidelines that require re-throwing errors after logging and event emission.

**Action:** Align error handling with project guidelines and update documentation.

### Claim 3: TSDoc clarity needed

**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The TSDoc for initDatabase should specify that errors are emitted via the event bus and not thrown, to clarify the contract for callers."

**Analysis:** The TSDoc should clearly document the error handling behavior to avoid confusion.

**Action:** Update TSDoc to clarify error handling contract.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Align error handling with project guidelines

Update the error handling to re-throw errors after logging and event emission, following project standards.

### 2. Update TSDoc documentation

Clarify the error handling contract in the function documentation.

### 3. Update comments

Remove misleading comments about not re-throwing errors.

## Validation

Changes align with project error handling guidelines and improve code clarity.
