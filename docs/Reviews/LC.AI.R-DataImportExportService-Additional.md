**File:** `electron/utils/database/DataImportExportService.ts`  
**Review Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Reviewer:** AI Agent  

## Additional Claims Analysis

### Claim 1: Missing class TSDoc
**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY FIXED**  
**Description:** "The DataImportExportService class is missing a TSDoc comment."

**Analysis:** This was already addressed in the previous review with comprehensive class documentation.

**Action:** No change needed.

### Claim 2-7: Repository method await concerns
**Status:** ❌ **FALSE POSITIVE (ALL)**  
**Description:** Multiple claims about missing await on repository internal methods.

**Analysis:** As verified in the previous review, all `deleteAllInternal`, `bulkInsertInternal`, and `importHistoryForMonitors` methods are synchronous and return void, not Promise. They are designed to work within transaction context synchronously. No await is needed or should be added.

**Action:** No changes needed - all methods are correctly called without await.

### Claim 8: isImportData TSDoc
**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY FIXED**  
**Description:** "The isImportData function is not documented with TSDoc."

**Analysis:** This was already addressed in the previous review with comprehensive documentation.

**Action:** No change needed.
