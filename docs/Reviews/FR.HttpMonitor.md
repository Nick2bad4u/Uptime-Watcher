# File Review: HttpMonitor.ts

## SOLID Principles Analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 75%
- **Primary responsibility**: HTTP/HTTPS endpoint monitoring - well-defined
- **Mixed concerns**: Class handles configuration management, request execution, retry logic, and error handling
- **Improvement needed**: Extract retry logic, error handling, and configuration management into separate services

### ‚úÖ Open-Closed Principle (OCP): 85%
- **Good extensibility**: Implements IMonitorService interface properly
- **Configuration-driven**: Behavior can be modified through configuration without code changes
- **Axios integration**: Uses dependency injection pattern with Axios
- **Minor issue**: Some timeout logic is hardcoded rather than configurable

### ‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): 100%
- **Perfect interface compliance**: Fully implements IMonitorService contract
- **Consistent behavior**: All methods work as expected by interface consumers
- **Type safety**: Proper error handling maintains interface contract

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 80%
- **Good interface design**: IMonitorService is focused and minimal
- **Type checking issue**: Relies on runtime type checking rather than type-safe design
- **Configuration coupling**: Config interface mixes concerns (HTTP and general settings)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 70%
- **Good abstractions**: Uses IMonitorService interface
- **Concrete dependencies**: Directly depends on Axios, constants, and utility functions
- **Improvement needed**: Should depend on HTTP client abstraction, not concrete Axios instance

**Overall SOLID Compliance: 82%** - Good but needs improvement

## Bugs Found

### üî¥ Critical Issues

#### 1. Type Safety Violation
**Location**: Lines 164-165
```typescript
const timeout = (monitor.timeout as number | undefined) ?? this.config.timeout ?? DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT;
const retryAttempts = (monitor.retryAttempts as number | undefined) ?? 3;
```
**Issue**: Using `as` type assertions to work around type system instead of proper typing
**Impact**: Runtime errors if assumptions are wrong
**Fix**: Implement proper type guards or optional property handling

#### 2. Inconsistent Configuration Handling
**Location**: Lines 107-114 (constructor) vs Lines 164-165 (check method)
**Issue**: Configuration precedence is inconsistent between initialization and runtime
**Impact**: Unexpected behavior when timeouts differ between config levels

#### 3. Error Context Loss
**Location**: Lines 246-250 (retry error handling)
**Issue**: Original error context is lost in retry wrapper
**Impact**: Debugging difficulties, poor error reporting

### üü° Medium Priority Issues

#### 1. Magic Numbers
**Location**: Line 165, Line 249
**Issue**: Hardcoded retry attempts (3) and total attempts calculation
**Impact**: Difficult to maintain and configure

#### 2. Inconsistent Logging
**Location**: Various locations
**Issue**: Development-only logging with inconsistent levels
**Impact**: Production debugging difficulties

## Code Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Excellent Documentation**: Comprehensive TSDoc with examples
2. **Good Error Handling**: Structured error responses
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking via interceptors
4. **Retry Logic**: Robust retry with exponential backoff

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
1. **Complex Method Sizes**: Some methods handle too many concerns
2. **Configuration Management**: Scattered configuration logic
3. **Type Safety**: Workarounds instead of proper types
4. **Testing**: Hard to unit test due to coupled concerns

## TSDoc Quality

### ‚úÖ Excellent Documentation
- **Complete coverage**: All public methods documented
- **Clear examples**: Good usage examples
- **Implementation details**: Internal methods well documented
- **Cross-references**: Good use of @see tags

### üìã Minor Enhancements Needed
- Add @throws documentation for specific error cases
- Document configuration precedence rules
- Add examples for error handling patterns

## Planned Fixes

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Fix Type Safety Issues** - Replace type assertions with proper type guards
2. **Standardize Configuration Handling** - Create clear precedence rules
3. **Improve Error Context** - Preserve error context through retry chain

### Phase 2: SOLID Principle Improvements
1. **Extract Retry Service** - Move retry logic to separate service
2. **Create HTTP Client Abstraction** - Remove direct Axios dependency
3. **Split Configuration Concerns** - Separate HTTP-specific vs general config

### Phase 3: Code Quality Enhancements
1. **Add Configuration Validation** - Validate config values at runtime
2. **Improve Error Types** - Create specific error classes for different failure modes
3. **Enhance Testing** - Make components more testable through dependency injection

## Implementation Priority

### Critical (Phase 1) - Must Fix
1. **Type Safety Violations** - Replace `as` assertions with type guards
2. **Configuration Consistency** - Establish clear precedence rules
3. **Error Context Preservation** - Maintain debugging context through retries

### High Priority (Phase 2) - Should Fix
1. **Service Extraction** - Extract retry and config management
2. **Dependency Abstraction** - Create HTTP client interface
3. **Error Classification** - Implement structured error types

### Medium Priority (Phase 3) - Nice to Have
1. **Enhanced Validation** - Runtime configuration validation
2. **Performance Metrics** - Advanced monitoring capabilities
3. **Debug Improvements** - Better development experience

## Conclusion

**HttpMonitor shows good architecture fundamentals** but suffers from some common issues in service classes that handle too many concerns. The interface implementation is solid, and the documentation is excellent.

**Primary issues**: Type safety workarounds, mixed responsibilities, and configuration inconsistencies. These are fixable without major architectural changes.

**Recommended approach**: Incremental refactoring to extract concerns while maintaining the solid foundation and excellent documentation.

**Quality Score: B+ (82/100)**
