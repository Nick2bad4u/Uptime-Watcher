**File:** `electron/utils/database/serviceFactory.ts`  
**Review Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Reviewer:** AI Agent  

## Claims Analysis

### Claim 1: Missing @file tag
**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The file-level TSDoc comment is missing the @file tag as per your documentation standards."

**Analysis:** The file documentation should include the @file tag for consistency with project standards.

**Action:** Add @file tag to the file header.

### Claim 2: Missing @implements or @see tag for LoggerAdapter
**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The LoggerAdapter class is missing a TSDoc @implements or @see tag to indicate which Logger interface it adapts."

**Analysis:** Adding reference to the Logger interface would improve clarity.

**Action:** Add @implements or @see reference to Logger interface.

### Claim 3: Missing TSDoc tags for createSiteCache
**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY IMPROVED**  
**Description:** "The function itself is missing a @function or @returns TSDoc tag for consistency."

**Analysis:** The function already has proper TSDoc with @returns. The @function tag is not typically used in TSDoc.

**Action:** No additional changes needed.

### Claim 4: enableStats: false rationale
**Status:** ✅ **VALID ISSUE**  
**Description:** "The StandardizedCache is instantiated with enableStats: false, but your cache class defaults to enableStats: true. Confirm this is intentional and document the rationale."

**Analysis:** The rationale should be documented more clearly in the TSDoc.

**Action:** Enhance documentation explaining why stats are disabled for temporary caches.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add @file tag to file header
2. Add @see reference to Logger interface for LoggerAdapter
3. Enhance documentation for enableStats rationale
