# Checkov configuration for GitHub Actions security scans
# Configuration follows modern best practices for 2025
# See: https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/CLI%20Command%20Reference.html

# Output format for better integration with CI/CD
output: cli,sarif

# Framework selection - only scan relevant frameworks for this project
framework:
    - github_actions
    - github_configuration
    - dockerfile
    - secrets
    - yaml
    - json

# Enable evaluation of variables for better accuracy

# Skip specific checks with detailed justifications
skip-check:
    # GitHub Actions Permission Checks
    - CKV_GHA_1 # Require job permissions write-all to be set to false
      # Justification: Electron app build process requires write access for artifact uploads and releases

    - CKV2_GHA_1 # Ensure top-level permissions are not set to write-all
      # Justification: Desktop app build workflow needs comprehensive permissions for secure artifact management

    # GitHub Actions Pinning Checks
    - CKV_GHA_6 # Require checkout action to be pinned to SHA version
      # Justification: Using semantic versioning (@v4) for official actions provides better maintainability
      # and security updates while maintaining readability. Risk is mitigated by using only official actions.

    # Workflow Input Checks
    - CKV_GHA_7 # Ensure workflow_dispatch inputs are NOT empty/blank
      # Justification: Manual trigger workflows without inputs are legitimate for this desktop application
      # where simple build/test triggers don't require parameters

# Security enhancements
# Enable secret scanning for all file types
enable-secret-scan-all-files: true

# Scan secrets in git history
scan-secrets-history: false # Disabled to avoid performance impact in CI

# Soft fail on low severity issues
soft-fail-on: LOW

# Hard fail on high and critical issues
hard-fail-on: HIGH,CRITICAL

# Skip paths that don't need security scanning
skip-path:
    - node_modules/
    - dist/
    - dist-electron/
    - coverage/
    - .vscode/
    - docs/assets/
