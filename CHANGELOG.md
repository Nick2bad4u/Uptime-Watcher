### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Extract coordinator and type definitions from UptimeOrchestrator

This commit refactors the `UptimeOrchestrator` to improve modularity and separation of concerns.

### Source Code Changes

üöú **[refactor]** Extracts history limit logic into a new `HistoryLimitCoordinator`.
-   This new coordinator class encapsulates the responsibility of listening for history limit updates from the database, validating the new limit, and forwarding the event to the renderer.
-   It maintains the last known limit to provide `previousLimit` telemetry in the forwarded event.
-   `UptimeOrchestrator` now instantiates and uses this coordinator, simplifying its own logic by removing the `handleDatabaseHistoryLimitUpdatedEvent` method and related properties.

üìù **[docs]** Moves `UptimeOrchestrator` type definitions to a dedicated `UptimeOrchestrator.types.ts` file.
-   This cleans up the main orchestrator file, separating complex interface declarations from the implementation logic.

üé® **[style]** Improves site sanitization logic in `SiteManager`.
-   Replaces the direct usage of `sanitizeSitesByIdentifier` with a local `getSanitizedSitesForManager` function that returns a strongly-typed snapshot. This enhances clarity and type safety within the manager.
-   The `sanitizeSitesByIdentifier` function in the shared `siteIntegrity.ts` file is simplified for better readability.

üîß **[build]** Standardizes Electron bridge readiness checks across the frontend.
-   Updates `createIpcServiceHelpers` to use a new centralized `waitForElectronAPI` utility.
-   The `waitForElectronAPI` function in `stores/utils.ts` is enhanced to accept an optional array of bridge contracts to validate.
-   Various service files (`EventsService`, `StateSyncService`) are updated to use the new validation patterns for event cleanup handlers, improving code consistency.

### Test and Development Changes

üß™ **[test]** Adds comprehensive tests for the new `HistoryLimitCoordinator`.
-   Verifies correct event forwarding, telemetry (`previousLimit`), and handling of invalid or negative limit values.

üß™ **[test]** Updates numerous test files to reflect the refactoring of the Electron bridge readiness checks.
-   Mocks are updated from `waitForElectronAPI` to the underlying `waitForElectronBridge` utility.
-   This affects tests for `DataService`, `EventsService`, `SettingsService`, `SystemService`, `MonitoringService`, `SiteService`, and several store hooks (`useSettingsStore`, `useSitesStore`), ensuring they align with the new initialization logic.

### üé® Styling

- üé® [style] Apply consistent code formatting across the project

This commit applies automated code formatting and style fixes across various files, ensuring consistency and improving readability.

üé® [style] Adjusts code formatting for consistency and brevity.
 - Collapses several multi-line function calls, array initializations, and `expect` statements in test files into single lines.
 - Standardizes indentation and spacing in test mocks and function arguments.
 - Removes extraneous newlines from test files.

üìù [docs] Improves JSDoc and comment formatting.
 - Aligns type definitions within JSDoc blocks in the custom ESLint plugin for better readability.
 - Adds minor formatting corrections to documentation blocks in test files.

- ‚ú® [feat] Introduce IPC automation and optimistic updates

This commit introduces a generation-first workflow for Electron IPC contracts and implements optimistic UI updates for manual monitor checks. It also refactors and clarifies development scripts for consistency.

‚ú® [feat] Adds optimistic updates for manual monitor checks.
-   When a user triggers a manual check, the UI now updates immediately with an optimistic status.
-   This avoids waiting for the full `monitor:check-completed` event, improving perceived performance.
-   The new `check-site-now` IPC channel returns an enriched payload that the renderer uses for the instant update.

üë∑ [ci] Implements an IPC automation workflow.
-   Adds a new script `npm run generate:ipc` to auto-generate IPC bridge typings and Markdown documentation from shared TypeScript schemas. This ensures contracts between main, renderer, and preload are always synchronized.
-   Introduces `npm run check:ipc` to verify that generated artifacts are up-to-date, which is now enforced in the CI pipeline.

üìù [docs] Creates a new `IPC_AUTOMATION_WORKFLOW.md` guide.
-   Documents the new generation-first process for developers, explaining how to modify IPC channels and regenerate the necessary files.
-   Updates all related development guides (`DEVELOPER_QUICK_START`, `README`, etc.) to reference the new scripts and workflow.

üîß [build] Standardizes development NPM scripts.
-   Renames `npm run start` to `npm run electron-dev` to better reflect its function of running Vite and Electron concurrently.
-   Updates `package.json` to allow forwarding command-line arguments to the Electron process (e.g., `npm run electron-dev -- --log-debug`).
-   Cleans up old script aliases and updates documentation to reflect the new canonical commands.

üöú [refactor] Adds TSDoc comments to the IPC generator script.
-   Improves maintainability by documenting functions and interfaces within `scripts/generate-ipc-artifacts.mts`.

- ‚ú® [feat] Add IPC artifact generation and drift detection

This commit introduces a comprehensive system for managing and verifying Inter-Process Communication (IPC) contracts, ensuring consistency between the main process, renderer, and documentation. It adds a new script to automatically generate IPC type definitions and documentation from the source code.

‚ú® [feat] IPC and Event System Enhancements
- Adds a new script (`generate-ipc-artifacts.mts`) to auto-generate the `eventsBridge.ts` type definitions and the `ipc-channel-inventory.md` documentation file from canonical source definitions.
- Introduces a new CI check (`npm run check:ipc`) to prevent drift between the source code and generated artifacts, ensuring the IPC contract remains consistent.
- Adds `fast-deep-equal` to the knip ignore list, as it is a dependency of the new generation script.

üìù [docs] New Renderer Integration Guide
- Adds a comprehensive `RENDERER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` to document the updated IPC contract, patterns for optimistic UI updates, and history limit synchronization.
- Updates the main documentation index to include the new guide.

üõ†Ô∏è [fix] Improve IPC Event Handling and Preload Guards
- Refactors the preload `eventsApi` to add more specific type guards for `monitoring:started`, `monitoring:stopped`, and `state-sync-event` payloads, improving runtime safety.
- Alphabetizes event channel definitions and handler registrations for better organization and consistency with generated artifacts.

üöú [refactor] Strengthen `UptimeOrchestrator` Logic
- Improves the handler for manual monitor checks (`handleManualCheckCompleted`) by destructuring the event payload more robustly and ensuring monitor/site data is always enriched before being broadcast to the renderer.
- Adds robust initialization logic for the history retention limit, falling back to a default value if the `DatabaseManager` fails or returns an invalid number.

üé® [style] Minor CSS and Code Style Adjustments
- Adjusts CSS for the compact site card header to improve wrapping and alignment of elements.
- Sorts properties in various event type definitions and log templates for improved readability and consistency.

üß™ [test] Update and Expand Test Coverage
- Updates Jest and Playwright tests to align with the refactored event handling and new IPC contract.
- Adds a test utility to reset the history limit subscription, enabling more reliable testing of the settings store's initialization logic.
- Corrects mock setups and test logic to use the updated, alphabetically sorted event API.

- ‚ú® [feat] Implement optimistic updates and IPC automation

This commit introduces significant enhancements to the application's IPC protocol, state synchronization, and developer tooling.

‚ú® [feat] Optimistic UI Updates & Event Sync
- Implements optimistic updates for manual monitor checks. The UI now reflects the check result immediately by applying the returned `StatusUpdate` payload, rather than waiting for the event broadcast.
- Introduces a new `settings:history-limit-updated` event to synchronize database retention policy changes (e.g., from imports or migrations) with the renderer's settings store, ensuring UI consistency. The payload includes both new and previous values for contextual display.

üöú [refactor] Standardize IPC Channel Naming
- Overhauls the IPC channel naming convention from `domain:action` (e.g., `sites:add`) to a verb-first, hyphenated format (e.g., `add-site`). This improves clarity and consistency across the API surface.
- Broadcast event channels retain their `domain:event-name` structure to distinguish them from invoke channels.

üõ†Ô∏è [tooling] Automate IPC Artifact Generation
- Adds new npm scripts to automate IPC contract management:
  - `npm run generate:ipc`: Rebuilds the preload bridge type definitions and generates a canonical IPC channel inventory markdown file.
  - `npm run check:ipc`: A CI script to detect and prevent drift between the source code schema and the generated documentation.

üìù [docs] Update Architecture & Development Guides
- Updates all relevant documentation, including ADRs, development guides, and API references, to reflect the new IPC naming convention and synchronization patterns.
- Adds a new auto-generated `ipc-channel-inventory.md` file as the single source of truth for all IPC channels.

- ‚ú® [feat] Introduce state sync delta tracking and improve status reporting

This update introduces comprehensive tracking of site synchronization changes and enhances the accuracy of state sync status reporting. It also includes several fixes and refactorings to improve data integrity and type safety.

‚ú® [feat] Implement Site Synchronization Delta Calculation
 - Adds a new utility, `calculateSiteSyncDelta`, to compute the difference between two collections of sites.
 - This function identifies added, removed, and updated sites, providing a structured `SiteSyncDelta` object.
 - The `fast-deep-equal` package is used for efficient and accurate structural comparisons of site objects.

‚ú® [feat] Integrate Delta Tracking into State Management
 - The main sites store (`useSitesStore`) now tracks the `lastSyncDelta`.
 - When a state synchronization event occurs, the store now calculates and records this delta.
 - This allows the UI and other services to react to specific changes (e.g., site additions or removals) rather than just reloading the entire list.

üõ†Ô∏è [fix] Preserve Previous Site State on Monitor Removal
 - In the `SiteManager`, when a monitor is removed, the site's state is now cloned *before* the modification.
 - This ensures that `internal:site:updated` events emit the correct "previous" site snapshot, accurately reflecting the state before the monitor was deleted.

üöú [refactor] Enhance State Sync Status Reporting
 - The `IpcService` now caches the synchronization status and listens for `sites:state-synchronized` events to keep it updated.
 - The `get-sync-status` IPC handler now returns this cached status, providing a more accurate and persistent representation of the last sync operation, rather than generating a new status on each call.

üé® [style] Improve Event Handler Type Safety
 - Strengthens type safety in `EventsService` for `onMonitoringStarted` and `onMonitoringStopped` events.
 - Type guards are now used to ensure that callbacks receive the correctly structured event payload, preventing potential runtime errors.

üß™ [test] Expand Test Coverage and Stability
 - Adds extensive new tests for the site sync delta calculation and state management logic.
 - Introduces a regression test in `UptimeOrchestrator` to verify that the `previousSite` snapshot is correctly preserved when monitors are removed.
 - Improves the stability of property-based fuzzing tests for the Settings component by ensuring a clean DOM state for each test iteration.

 - Modifies flexbox properties to horizontally center the icon and text within the status item container for improved visual alignment.
 - Replaces logical CSS properties (`inline-size`) with physical properties (`width`) for broader consistency.

üîß [build] Refines VS Code task configurations for a better development experience.
 - Ensures problem matchers for linting and testing apply to all open documents, not just the active one.
 - Configures tasks to use a new terminal for each run, preventing potential state conflicts from previous runs.

### üì¶ Dependencies

- [dependency] Update version 17.4.0 [`(cc70f23)`](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/Uptime-Watcher/commit/cc70f2344c3611939441c52e33d6474c55d6dbb7)



### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Relocate settings management to a dedicated domain

üöú [refactor] Creates a new `settings` IPC domain and moves all settings-related functionality out of the `data` domain. This improves code organization and clarifies the separation of concerns between general data operations (import/export, backups) and application settings management.
- Moves `resetSettings`, `getHistoryLimit`, and `updateHistoryLimit` from the `data` API domain to a new `settings` API domain.
- Creates a dedicated `setupSettingsHandlers` method in `IpcService` to register all settings-related IPC channels.
- Establishes a new `SettingsHandlerValidators` group for IPC parameter validation, separating it from `DataHandlerValidators`.

üõ†Ô∏è [fix] Enhances site synchronization logic to handle duplicate identifiers.
- Introduces a `sanitizeSitesSnapshot` utility to detect and remove duplicate sites received from the backend during state synchronization.
- The first occurrence of a site is kept, and any subsequent duplicates are discarded to prevent store corruption.
- Adds detailed logging when duplicates are detected to improve observability.

‚ö° [perf] Adds robust cleanup validation for event service subscriptions.
- Implements a new `subscribeWithValidatedCleanup` utility to ensure that all event subscriptions return a valid cleanup function from the preload bridge.
- Provides fallback cleanup handlers and logs detailed errors if an invalid value (e.g., `undefined`) is returned, preventing potential memory leaks and runtime errors.

üìù [docs] Updates API documentation to reflect the new `settings` domain.
- Moves the `resetSettings` function documentation from the Data API section to the new Settings API section.

üß™ [test] Updates and expands tests for the new `settings` domain and enhanced cleanup logic.
- Refactors tests for `IpcService`, preload APIs, and frontend services to align with the new domain structure.
- Adds comprehensive tests for the `EventsService` to verify correct handling of invalid cleanup handlers and cleanup errors.
- Adds property-based tests to ensure the `useSiteSync` hook correctly sanitizes payloads with duplicate site identifiers.

- üöú [refactor] Implement Site Mutation Pipeline for data consistency

This refactoring introduces a standardized "Site Mutation Pipeline" to ensure transactional integrity and data consistency across the database, cache, and event bus when modifying site information.

‚ú® **[feat] Site Mutation Pipeline**
-   Adds a strict, layered contract for all write operations, ensuring the database, in-memory caches, and monitoring systems remain synchronized.
-   The flow is now: `SiteManager` (invariant checks) ‚Üí `SiteWriterService` (transaction management & cache updates) ‚Üí `Repository` (SQL execution).

üöú **[refactor] `SiteManager.removeMonitor`**
-   Rewrites the monitor removal logic to adhere to the new pipeline.
-   Instead of direct repository calls and manual cache refreshes, it now uses `SiteWriterService` to handle the mutation atomically.
-   Adds a domain invariant check to prevent the removal of the last monitor from a site, throwing a specific error.
-   Ensures `validateSite` is called with the proposed changes before committing to the database.
-   Events are now emitted only *after* the transaction and cache update are successfully completed by the `SiteWriterService`, guaranteeing consumers receive a consistent state.

üìù **[docs] Development Patterns Guide**
-   Adds a comprehensive "Site Mutation Pipeline" section to the development guide.
-   Includes a sequence diagram, layer responsibilities, an invariant checklist, and usage guidelines to document the new pattern.

üß™ **[test] Update Unit & Comprehensive Tests**
-   Overhauls tests for `removeMonitor` to reflect the new pipeline logic, covering success cases, error handling (like removing the last monitor), and interaction with the `SiteWriterService`.
-   Adds new tests for the `getSiteSnapshotForMutation` helper to verify its caching and cloning behavior.
-   Adjusts `SiteRepository` tests to confirm that `upsert` operations are now correctly wrapped in a transaction.

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Clarify monitoring API and standardize IPC handling

This commit refactors the monitoring API for clarity, improves IPC handling, and enhances event data validation and context.

‚ú® [feat] Introduce explicit monitoring API methods
-   Splits the ambiguous `startMonitoringForSite` and `stopMonitoringForSite` methods, which previously used an optional `monitorId`, into distinct functions:
    -   `startMonitoringForMonitor` / `stopMonitoringForMonitor`: Target a single monitor and require a `monitorId`.
    -   `startMonitoringForSite` / `stopMonitoringForSite`: Target all monitors within a site.
-   This change improves API ergonomics and removes ambiguity for developers.

üöú [refactor] Standardize `quitAndInstall` IPC handling
-   Migrates the `quit-and-install` IPC call from `ipcMain.on` to `ipcMain.handle`.
-   This makes it an async, promise-based operation consistent with other IPC handlers, allowing the renderer to await confirmation.
-   The renderer-side `SystemService` is updated to `await` this call and handle potential errors.

‚ö° [perf] Enhance event payload validation
-   Replaces local, manual type guards in the preload script (`eventsApi.ts`, `stateSyncApi.ts`) with robust, schema-based validators (`validateSiteSnapshot`, `safeParseStateSyncEventData`) from the shared package.
-   This strengthens type safety at the IPC boundary and centralizes validation logic.

‚ú® [feat] Add `cascade` flag to site removal events
-   Introduces a `cascade: boolean` flag to `internal:site:removed` events.
-   This flag differentiates between single site removals (`cascade: false`) and bulk removal operations (`cascade: true`), providing more context to event listeners.

üìù [docs] Update API documentation
-   Refreshes `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` to reflect the new, more explicit monitoring methods (`start/stopMonitoringForMonitor` and `start/stopMonitoringForSite`).

üé® [style] Adjust compact site card layout
-   Updates the CSS for the compact site card status section to use `display: grid` for better alignment and responsiveness on smaller screens.

üß™ [test] Update tests for API and IPC changes
-   Aligns unit and comprehensive tests across the application to match the refactored monitoring API, standardized `quitAndInstall` IPC handling, and new event validation logic.

- üöú [refactor] Improve service initialization and update dependencies

This commit introduces several refactorings, dependency updates, and test improvements across the codebase. The most significant change is the enhancement of the service initialization logic in the `ServiceContainer` to more robustly handle both synchronous and asynchronous initializers.

### Source Code Changes

*   **üöú [refactor] `electron/services/ServiceContainer.ts`:**
    *   Improves the service initialization process to correctly handle methods that return a `Promise` and those that do not.
    *   A new `isPromiseLike` type guard is introduced to check if an initializer's return value has a `then` method.
    *   The `tryInitializeService` method now conditionally `await`s the result only if it's a promise, making the system more flexible.
    *   The type for `PossiblyInitializableService`'s `initialize` method is simplified.

*   **üé® [style] `src/services/EventsService.ts`:**
    *   Corrects formatting for JSDoc code examples.
    *   Standardizes import statements for better consistency.

*   **üé® [style] `shared/types/eventsBridge.ts`:**
    *   Standardizes import statement formatting.

### Build & Configuration

*   **üîß [build] Vitest Configurations:**
    *   Updates several Vitest configuration files (`vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.zero-coverage.config.ts`, `vitest.storybook.config.ts`) to use the renamed `ViteUserConfigFnObject` type from `vitest/config`.
    *   Adds `as any` type assertions to work around outdated or incomplete type definitions in Vitest and its coverage plugins, silencing type errors.
    *   Disables specific ESLint rules in configuration files where type overrides are necessary.

### Test Suite Improvements

*   **üß™ [test] General Test Refinements:**
    *   Removes unused imports and variables from several test files, cleaning up the test code.
    *   Replaces numeric separators (e.g., `5_000`) with standard integers (`5000`) in test timeouts for consistency.
    *   Converts `NodeList` collections to arrays using `Array.from()` before iteration to prevent potential issues with live collections during DOM manipulation in tests.

*   **üß™ [test] `electron/test/setup.ts`:**
    *   Refactors `fs` mock creation by adding explicit type casts to mocked functions, improving type safety and clarity within the test setup.

*   **üß™ [test] `src/test/utils/cacheSync.test.ts`:**
    *   Refactors the setup for store mocks (`useMonitorTypesStore`, `useSitesStore`) to be more direct and less reliant on `vi.spyOn` with complex implementations, simplifying the test structure.

- üöú [refactor] Improve service initialization and modernize test mocks

This commit introduces several refactoring improvements across the application, focusing on enhancing the service initialization process and standardizing the mocking strategy in tests for better debugging and maintainability.

### Source Code Changes üöÄ

*   **üîß [build] Refactor Service Initialization**
    *   Introduces a `tryInitializeService` helper in the `ServiceContainer` to safely call optional `initialize` methods on services.
    *   Adds a `hasInitializeMethod` type guard for improved type safety and robustness during the application's bootstrap sequence.
    *   Adds debug logging for services that do not have an initializer, improving diagnostics.

*   **üõ†Ô∏è [fix] Correct DNS Resolution Promise Typing**
    *   Fixes a type issue in the `checkDnsResolution` utility where a timeout promise was incorrectly typed, preventing potential runtime errors.

*   **üé® [style] Modernize Property Checking**
    *   Replaces `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` with the more modern and direct `Object.hasOwn()` in `WindowService`.

### Test Suite Enhancements üß™

*   **üöú [refactor] Standardize Mocking Strategy**
    *   Replaces anonymous arrow functions in `vi.fn()` with named functions (e.g., `vi.fn(function MyMock() { ... })`) across numerous test files. This greatly improves debugging by providing meaningful names in stack traces.
    *   Introduces a `createConstructableMock` helper to simplify the creation of mock classes, ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate.

*   **üß™ [test] Improve Test Isolation and Accuracy**
    *   Enhances test isolation by resetting mock states and using `mockImplementationOnce` where appropriate, particularly in `ApplicationService` tests.
    *   Corrects a test assertion in `ServiceContainer.fixed.test.ts` to reflect the expected behavior accurately.
    *   Adds explicit timeouts to several long-running database repository tests to prevent CI hangs.

*   **üßπ [chore] Update Test Utilities and Mocks**
    *   Improves the `node:fs` mock in the global test setup to be more robust by delegating to the actual module while allowing specific functions to be spied on or replaced.
    *   Refactors test hooks in `renderHook` calls to include cleanup (`unmount`) to prevent memory leaks between tests.

- üõ†Ô∏è [fix] Refactor monitor removal workflow for reliability

This commit refactors the monitor removal process to improve reliability and data consistency.

- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Orchestrator-Owned Monitor Deletion**: Changes the monitor deletion process to be orchestrated by the backend, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
   - üîÑ The `removeMonitor` function in `UptimeOrchestrator` now returns the updated `Site` snapshot after the monitor has been removed, instead of a boolean.
   - üõ†Ô∏è The `SiteManager.removeMonitor` method now returns the updated `Site` snapshot after monitor removal, throwing an error if the updated site is not found.
   - üóëÔ∏è Removes the compensation logic in `UptimeOrchestrator` as the operation is now considered complete when the database update succeeds.
   - üß™ Updates tests in `UptimeOrchestrator.test.ts` to reflect the change in return type and error handling.
- üíæ **State Management**: Updates the frontend state management to align with the backend changes.
   - ‚öõÔ∏è The `SiteService.removeMonitor` now returns a Promise resolving to the updated `Site` record.
   - ‚öõÔ∏è Updates `useSiteOperations.ts` to use `applySavedSiteToStore` to persist the backend snapshot, ensuring duplicate identifier detection, logging, and future invariants remain centralized.
   - üìù Updates TSDoc in `stores/sites.md` to reflect the new monitor removal workflow and the use of `applySavedSiteToStore`.

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Refactor event emission for site/monitor updates

This commit refactors the event emission process for site and monitor updates to improve consistency and streamline data flow.

- üîÑ **Managers Emit Internal Lifecycle Topics**:
  - `SiteManager` and `MonitorManager` now emit `internal:site:*` and `internal:monitor:*` events for CRUD and monitoring lifecycle operations instead of public events.
  - High-frequency telemetry like `monitor:status-changed` continues to originate directly from `MonitorManager`.
- ‚û°Ô∏è **`UptimeOrchestrator` as Public Source of Truth**:
  - The orchestrator consumes internal lifecycle events, sanitizes metadata, and emits public events (`site:*`, `monitoring:*`, `monitor:*`) plus `cache:invalidated` notifications.
  - Global monitoring transitions now use `{ type: "all" }` for cache invalidation, enabling renderers to perform a full resync.
- üëÇ **Frontend Listens Only to Orchestrator Output**:
  - `ApplicationService` subscribes to the orchestrator and uses `RendererEventBridge` to fan out events to windows, ensuring consistent payloads across renderers.
- üêõ **Fixes**:
  - Ensures that site data is available when `internal:site:removed` is emitted by including the site snapshot in the event data.
  - Handles cases where site data might be missing by providing fallback values and logging warnings.
- üß™ **Tests**:
  - Updates tests to reflect the new event emission patterns and ensure proper cache invalidation.
  - Adds tests to verify global cache invalidation for bulk monitor start/stop events.
- üìù **Documentation**:
  - Updates documentation to reflect the layered emission strategy and the role of the `UptimeOrchestrator` as the single source of truth for public events.

Updates ESLint rules to enforce the use of the `@app` alias for imports within the `src` directory and restricts direct imports from Electron in renderer modules.

- üé® [style] Adds new ESLint rules:
  -  `renderer-no-electron-import`: Disallows renderer code from directly importing Electron packages or backend modules, encouraging the use of preload bridges or shared contracts instead. üö´
   -  This rule checks `ImportDeclaration`, `ImportExpression`, and `CallExpression` nodes for invalid Electron dependencies.
  - `prefer-app-alias`: Enforces the use of the `@app` alias for referencing renderer code from outside the `src` directory, preventing relative deep imports. üöÄ
   -  The rule provides a fix to automatically replace relative paths with the `@app` alias.
- üìù [docs] Updates the consistency guide to reflect the new `@app` alias rule. üìö
- üßπ [chore] Updates benchmark import path for SettingsService. ‚úÖ
- üß™ [test] Adds new `tsconfig.json` files for electron and shared test directories. üß™
- üßπ [chore] Disables `@jcoreio/implicit-dependencies/no-implicit` rule in test files. üõ†Ô∏è

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

- üõ†Ô∏è [fix] Improve site management and event handling

This commit refactors site management and event handling to improve data consistency and streamline inter-process communication.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Site Management Improvements**:
 - Normalizes cache updates through a shared utility to guarantee event emission when a site is added.
  - This ensures that the cache is consistent and that all relevant events are triggered.
 - Sanitizes site data before emitting events to prevent unintended data exposure.
  - This enhances data integrity by ensuring that only safe data is shared.
 - Emits internal site events ("internal:site:added", "internal:site:removed") to provide more granular control over site lifecycle events.
  - These events allow internal components to react specifically to site addition or removal.
 - ‚ö° Updates site removal logic to ensure cache and event consistency.
  - Ensures sites are properly removed from the cache before removal events are fired.
- üìù **IPC Service**:
 - Removes the `RendererEventBridge` dependency from the `IpcService`.
  - This simplifies the `IpcService` by removing an unnecessary dependency.
 - ‚ôªÔ∏è **Event Handling**:
  - Forwards `sites:state-synchronized` events from the orchestrator to the renderer, ensuring that all renderer processes are kept in sync with the latest site state.
  - This maintains UI consistency across all application windows.
- üß™ **Testing**:
 - Updates comprehensive tests for `SiteManager` to accurately mock cache operations.
  - Ensures cache operations are reliably mocked to mimic real-world behavior.
- üßπ **Other Changes**:
 - Registers database event bus for event forwarding.
  - Enables the forwarding of events from the database event bus to other parts of the application.
 - Adds new events to the list of forwarded events in `ServiceContainer`.
  - Ensures that new events are properly forwarded to the appropriate listeners.
 - Removes unnecessary `sendStateSyncEvent` calls from `IpcService`.
  - This reduces redundancy and potential inconsistencies in state synchronization.
- üé® **UI**:
 - Adds a status subscription indicator to the header, providing real-time feedback on the health of the app's event listeners.
  - Includes logic for retrying subscriptions and displaying detailed listener states.
- üìù **Documentation**:
 - Updates ADR_005_IPC_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md to reflect changes to IpcService.

 - üß™ Updates `src/test/stores/sites/utils/operationHelpers.test.ts` to ensure tests are up to date with changes.
 - ‚úÖ Adds a new test case to `src/test/stores/sites/SiteService.test.ts` to cover the `updateSite` function.
- üß™ **UI Store Error handling**:
 - ‚úÖ Adds error handling and logging to `useUIStore.ts` when opening external URLs fails.
  - Improves the reliability of the UI by gracefully handling errors when opening external links.
- üêõ **Bug Fix**:
 - üêõ Fixes an issue in `App.tsx` where the `subscribeToStatusUpdates` function could encounter issues.
  - Adds a check for the `success` property in the subscription result and logs a warning if the subscription fails.
- ‚ö° **Performance**:
 - ‚ö° Improves the efficiency of status updates by using incremental updates.
- üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**:
 - üß™ Adds tests to `useSiteSync.comprehensive.test.ts` to cover the new status update subscription logic.
- üîÑ Updates the `subscribeToStatusUpdates` function in `useSiteSync.ts` to return a promise that resolves with a `StatusUpdateSubscriptionSummary` object.
- üìù Adds a new type `StatusUpdateSubscriptionSummary` to `src/stores/sites/baseTypes.ts` to represent the summary of a status update subscription.
- üîÑ Updates the `StatusUpdateManager` class in `src/stores/sites/utils/statusUpdateHandler.ts` to return a `StatusUpdateSubscriptionResult` object when subscribing to status updates.
- üóëÔ∏è **Code Cleanup**:
 - üóëÔ∏è Removes unused code from `electron/test/preload/domains/monitoringApi.comprehensive.test.ts` and `electron/test/preload.missing-branches.test.ts`.
  - This removes the test case for `monitoringApi.removeMonitor` and the corresponding expectation in `preload.missing-branches.test.ts`.

- ‚ú® [feat] Introduce global confirmation dialog and refactor cache TTL

This commit introduces several key enhancements, focusing on UI consistency and code clarity. The primary changes include implementing a centralized confirmation dialog to replace native browser confirms and refactoring the cache configuration to use a more intuitive `ttl` property.

‚ú® **[feat] Add Global Confirmation Dialog**
 - Implements a new, non-blocking `ConfirmDialog` component and a corresponding `useConfirmDialog` hook.
 - Provides a global `requestConfirmation` function managed by a Zustand store (`useConfirmDialogStore`) to display modal confirmations.
 - This replaces all instances of `window.confirm` and `globalThis.confirm` for destructive actions (like deleting sites/monitors or resetting settings), offering a consistent and modern UX.
 - The dialog is integrated into the main `App` component and is controlled via a centralized store, ensuring only one can be active at a time.

üöú **[refactor] Standardize Cache TTL Configuration**
 - Renames the `defaultTTL` property to `ttl` across the entire `StandardizedCache` and `TypedCache` implementation.
 - This change clarifies that the property sets a cache-level time-to-live, not just a default that can be overridden.
 - All related configurations, documentation (including ADRs), and tests have been updated to reflect this new, more intuitive naming convention.
 - The cache now emits `undefined` for the TTL in events when expiration is disabled (TTL <= 0), improving event data clarity.

üöú **[refactor] Improve Unique ID Generation**
 - Simplifies unique ID generation by exclusively using `globalThis.crypto.randomUUID()`.
 - Removes the previous fallback logic that used `Date.now()` and `Math.random()`.
 - This change enforces a dependency on a modern, secure, and more reliable method for creating unique identifiers, throwing an error if `crypto.randomUUID` is unavailable.

üß™ **[test] Enhance Test Suites**
 - Updates all relevant tests to use the new `useConfirmDialog` mock instead of spying on `window.confirm`.
 - Refactors cache tests to align with the `defaultTTL` -> `ttl` rename.
 - Improves test mocks for `matchMedia` and `crypto` to be more robust and accurate.

üßπ **[chore] Update BeastMode Chatmode**
 - Adds `think` and `problems` tools to the agent's capabilities.
 - Updates instructions to reflect new tool usage and enforce TSDoc commenting.

    *   Introduces a compatibility shim for `@storybook/preview-api` to ensure addon compatibility.
    *   Removes the explicit `title` property from story metadata, allowing Storybook to infer it from the file path for better organization.
*   **Improved Monitor Display**:
    *   The monitor selector now intelligently displays the `host:port` combination for monitors where the port is non-standard (not 80 or 443), providing more context at a glance.
*   **Enhanced AI Capabilities**:
    *   Expands Beast Mode's toolset with Tavily's `crawl` and `search` capabilities for more advanced web interactions.

üöú **Refactoring**
*   **Sequential Task Execution**:
    *   Introduces a `runSequentially` helper in `MonitorManager` to abstract and centralize the pattern of executing asynchronous monitor operations in order. This simplifies methods like `startAll` and `stopAll` by removing repetitive `for...of` loops with `await` and associated ESLint disable comments.
*   **Form Submission Logic**:
    *   Decomposes the monitor creation and validation logic in the "Add Site" form into smaller, single-responsibility functions. This makes the form submission process more modular, readable, and easier to extend with new monitor types.

- ‚ú® [feat] Add four advanced monitor types and supporting documentation

This commit introduces four new advanced monitor types to enhance system observability and provides comprehensive documentation for the project's architecture and tooling.

### ‚ú® Source Code Features
- **Adds Four New Monitor Types**:
  - `CDN Edge Consistency`: Compares responses from multiple edge locations against a baseline origin URL to detect content or status drift.
  - `Replication Lag`: Tracks database replication by comparing timestamps between primary and replica status endpoints.
  - `Server Heartbeat`: Polls a heartbeat endpoint, validates its status, and checks for timestamp drift to ensure services are responsive.
  - `WebSocket Keepalive`: Verifies WebSocket connections by sending ping frames and expecting a pong response within a specified delay.
- **Introduces New Shared Utilities**:
  - Adds helper functions for parsing URL lists, extracting nested fields from JSON objects using dot-notation, and normalizing various timestamp formats into milliseconds. These utilities support the complex data handling required by the new monitors.
- **Enhances the "Add Monitor" Form**:
  - The UI form for adding/editing monitors is updated with new dynamic fields corresponding to each new monitor type.
  - State management (`useAddSiteForm` hook) is extended to handle the new fields, including their values, setters, and validation logic.
  - The form submission process now correctly constructs monitor objects for the new types.

### üìù Documentation

- ‚ú® [feat] Add advanced monitor types and system documentation

‚ú® [feat] Implements four new advanced monitor types to expand system health checking capabilities.
 - **CDN Edge Consistency Monitor**: Compares responses from multiple CDN edge locations against a baseline origin. It uses content hashing (SHA256) to detect mismatches in status codes or response bodies, reporting `degraded` for inconsistencies and `down` for widespread failures.
 - **Replication Monitor**: Checks the time lag between primary and replica database or service endpoints. It extracts timestamps from JSON responses and reports a `degraded` status if the lag exceeds a configurable threshold.
 - **Server Heartbeat Monitor**: Validates a service's health by checking a heartbeat endpoint. It ensures the service reports an expected status value and that its reported timestamp is within an acceptable drift from the current time.
 - **WebSocket Keepalive Monitor**: Establishes a WebSocket connection, sends a `ping`, and waits for a `pong` or any message. It reports `degraded` if no response is received within a specified window and `down` if the connection fails.

üìù [docs] Adds new architecture and workflow diagrams to enhance system understanding.
 - A sequence diagram for the "Scheduled Monitor Check Lifecycle" is added, detailing the flow from scheduling to UI updates.
 - A flowchart for the "Site Provisioning Control Plane" is included, illustrating the process of adding a new site from the UI to the backend persistence layer.

üîß [build] Updates project dependencies to support new features.
 - Adds `ws` and `@types/ws` to dependencies for the WebSocket monitor implementation.

üßπ [chore] Updates the BeastMode chatmode tool configuration.
 - Refines the available tools, removing several legacy or unused commands and adding new capabilities like `fileSearch`, `runInTerminal`, and `websearch`.

- ‚ú® [feat] Add HTTP Header, JSON, and Latency monitors

This commit introduces three new advanced HTTP monitor types, expanding the application's monitoring capabilities.

### ‚ú® New Monitor Types
- **HTTP Header Match:** Verifies that a specific header exists in an HTTP response and matches an expected value. This is useful for checking `Content-Type`, caching headers, or custom application headers.
- **HTTP JSON Match:** Fetches a JSON response and validates the value at a specified dot-notation path (e.g., `data.items[0].status`). This allows for deep inspection of API health and data integrity.
- **HTTP Latency Threshold:** Measures the response time of an endpoint and flags it as "degraded" if it exceeds a configured threshold in milliseconds. This helps in tracking and enforcing performance SLOs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend Implementation
- Adds three new monitor service classes (`HttpHeaderMonitor`, `HttpJsonMonitor`, `HttpLatencyMonitor`) to encapsulate the checking logic for each new type.
- Updates the `EnhancedMonitorChecker` to route check requests for the new monitor types to their respective services.
- Registers the new monitor types in the `MonitorTypeRegistry`, defining their metadata, UI configuration, validation schemas, and service factories.

### üé® Frontend & Shared Code
- Extends the shared `Monitor` type and Zod validation schemas to include the new configuration fields (`headerName`, `expectedHeaderValue`, `jsonPath`, `expectedJsonValue`, `maxResponseTime`).
- Updates the `monitorOperations` utility in the renderer to correctly handle default values and data mapping for the new monitor types when creating or editing them.

### üß™ Testing & üìù Documentation
- Adds comprehensive unit tests for each new monitor service, covering success, failure, and edge cases.
- Expands property-based tests to ensure the new monitor schemas are robust and handle arbitrary data correctly.
- Updates the `NEW_MONITOR_TYPE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` guide to reflect the latest file structures and testing requirements, keeping developer documentation current.

### üöú Refactoring & System Integration
-   **Backend**: The `SslMonitor` service is integrated into the `EnhancedMonitorChecker` and registered in the `MonitorTypeRegistry`, enabling the system to route and process SSL checks.
-   **Shared**: New types and Zod validation schemas (`sslMonitorSchema`) are added to ensure type safety and strict validation for SSL monitor configurations across the entire application.
-   **Frontend**: UI logic is updated to handle the new `certificateWarningDays` field in forms and state management.

### üìù Documentation
-   The developer guide for implementing new monitor types has been completely rewritten. It now uses the concrete SSL monitor implementation as its primary, real-world example, replacing the previous theoretical guide.

### üßπ Chores & Maintenance
-   Updates various development dependencies, including `@docusaurus`, `@eslint-react`, and `knip`.
-   Adds a configuration file for `npm-check-updates` to standardize dependency management.
-   Refines ESLint rules and configurations for improved code quality and consistency with React 19 practices.

### ‚ö° Performance

- ‚ö° [perf] Standardize array creation with Array.from for improved performance

This commit refactors the codebase to consistently use `Array.from()` instead of the spread syntax (`...`) for creating new arrays from iterables like Sets, other arrays, and Maps. This change is motivated by performance benefits, as `Array.from()` is generally more optimized, especially for large iterables.

Additionally, this update leverages the optional mapping function in `Array.from(iterable, mapFn)` to combine the creation and mapping of new arrays into a single, more efficient operation.

Key changes include:

*   ‚ö° **Performance & Style:**
    *   Replaces all instances of array spread syntax (`[...iterable]`) with `Array.from(iterable)`. This applies to creating shallow copies of arrays and converting Sets, Maps, and other iterables into arrays.
    *   Consolidates `.map()` calls that immediately follow an array creation into the second argument of `Array.from()`, reducing intermediate array allocations.
    *   Disables the `unicorn/prefer-spread` ESLint rule to enforce this new convention.
*   üöú **Refactor Zod Schemas:**
    *   The Zod schema type definitions in `shared/types/schemaTypes.ts` are refactored for better clarity and organization.
    *   Moves away from generic shapes to explicit, flattened type definitions for each monitor type (`HttpMonitorSchemaType`, `PortMonitorSchemaType`, etc.), improving readability.
*   üß™ **Test Updates:**
    *   Updates numerous test files across benchmarks, unit tests, and fuzzing tests to align with the new `Array.from()` convention.

    *   Adds comprehensive checks for backend, frontend (store integration), and utility function scenarios.
    *   Verifies correct behavior with invalid loggers, failing store methods, and various non-Error thrown values.
    *   Ensures the system now warns to the console if a provided logger fails during error reporting.

### üîß Build & Configuration Improvements
*   **TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):**
    *   Refines compiler options for stricter, more modern standards by enabling `verbatimModuleSyntax` and disabling legacy decorator options.
    *   Simplifies `lib` and `include` arrays for better clarity.
    *   Moves `tsBuildInfoFile` output from the `dist` to a dedicated `cache` directory to separate build artifacts from cache files.
*   **Vite & Vitest Configuration:**
    *   Dynamically configures test runner thread counts (`maxThreads`) based on the environment (`CI` vs. local) to optimize resource usage.
    *   Enables single-threaded execution in CI environments for stability.
    *   Cleans up test reporters, keeping the output concise by default.
    *   Corrects a Vite cache directory path.

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Standardize state sync APIs and response types

This commit refactors the state synchronization, site, and monitor removal APIs to provide more structured and consistent data contracts between the main and renderer processes.

### Source Code Changes

*   **‚ú® [feat] New State Sync Types**
    *   Introduces dedicated types for state synchronization (`StateSyncStatusSummary`, `StateSyncFullSyncResult`) in a new `shared/types/stateSync.ts` file. This improves type safety and clarifies the data structures for sync operations.

*   **üöú [refactor] State Sync API**
    *   Updates the `stateSyncApi` to use the new, more descriptive types for `getSyncStatus` and `requestFullSync`.
    *   Enhances the `isStateSyncEventData` type guard for more robust validation of incoming event data.
    *   Standardizes the event channel name to `state-sync-event`.
    *   Refines the `StateSyncEventData` interface by renaming `siteId` to `siteIdentifier` and updating the allowed `action` and `source` values for better clarity.

*   **üöú [refactor] IPC Handlers**
    *   Modifies the IPC handlers for `request-full-sync` and `get-sync-status` to return payloads that conform to the new `StateSyncFullSyncResult` and `StateSyncStatusSummary` types.

*   **üé® [style] API Return Types**
    *   Changes `removeSite` and `removeMonitor` API methods to return a `Promise<boolean>` indicating the success of the operation, rather than returning the removed object or `void`. This simplifies the API contract.

*   **üßπ [chore] Site Store Updates**
    *   Updates the sites store (`useSiteSync`, `SiteService`, etc.) to align with the new API contracts and type definitions from the backend.
    *   `getSyncStatus` now expects the `StateSyncStatusSummary` object.
    *   `removeSite` and `removeMonitor` now correctly handle the boolean return value.

### Testing and Configuration

*   **üß™ [test] Update Preload and Store Tests**
    *   Revises comprehensive tests for `monitoringApi`, `sitesApi`, and `stateSyncApi` to match the updated API signatures and response structures.
    *   Adjusts store-level tests (`useSitesStore`) to reflect the changes in service calls and data handling.

*   **üîß [build] ESlint Configuration**
    *   Disables the `boundaries/element-types` ESLint rule to resolve configuration conflicts.
    *   Adds `execute_command` and `get_diagnostics` tools to the BeastMode chatmode configuration.

- üöú [refactor] Refine ESLint boundaries and apply code formatting

This commit introduces a comprehensive refactoring of the ESLint configuration, primarily focusing on architectural boundaries, and applies consistent code formatting across several files.

### ESLint Configuration (`eslint.config.mjs`)
*   **Architectural Boundaries Refactored**: The `eslint-plugin-boundaries` rules have been significantly overhauled to enforce a clearer, more hierarchical dependency structure across the frontend, backend, and shared modules.
    -   Centralizes boundary element definitions for concepts like `constants` and `types`.
    -   Replaces large, complex `element-types` rule sets with more granular and consistent import permissions. For example, foundational modules like `constants` can be imported by most other layers, while higher-level modules have stricter import limitations.
    -   Disables the `boundaries/no-ignored` rule to clean up warnings, likely as part of the transition to the new configuration.
    -   Adds stricter rules for single-file modules (e.g., `shared/types.ts`) to prevent them from being treated as directories.

### Developer Tooling & Scripts
*   üßπ **[chore]** The `mockServiceWorker.js` file has been auto-formatted to align with project coding styles (e.g., consistent use of double quotes and semicolons).
*   üìù **[docs]** The `download-sqlite3-wasm.mjs` script is enhanced with JSDoc comments for all major functions, improving type-checking and developer understanding. Type errors in `catch` blocks are explicitly acknowledged using `@ts-expect-error`.

### Documentation & Testing
*   üìù **[docs]** Removes extraneous backticks from a comment block in `Settings.input-fuzzing.test.tsx`.

- üöú [refactor] Consolidate build output directories into `dist/`

This refactoring streamlines the project's build process by consolidating all build artifacts into a single `dist/` directory. It removes the previously separate `dist-electron/`, `dist-shared/`, and other temporary build directories.

This change simplifies configuration across the entire repository, improving consistency and maintainability for various tools.

*   üöú [refactor] Updates TypeScript configurations (`tsconfig.*.json` files) to redirect their output directories (`outDir`) into subfolders within a unified `.cache/builds/dist/` structure (e.g., `dist/test/electron`). This centralizes all compiled test and application code.
*   üîß [build] Modifies `package.json` scripts (`clean`, `lint:circular:*`, `madge:*`, `sqlite:clean-wasm`) to remove references to the old `dist-electron` and `dist-shared` directories. The `files` array for packaging is also updated to reflect the new structure.
*   üßπ [chore] Removes `dist-electron`, `dist-shared`, and their variants from numerous configuration and ignore files across the project, including:
    -   `.gitignore` to stop tracking the old directories.
    -   `.vscode/settings.json` to clean up the editor's file tree and search.
    -   Linter configs (`.prettierignore`, `.stylelintignore`, `eslint.config.mjs`, etc.) to ensure build artifacts are consistently ignored.
    -   CI/CD and analysis tool configs (`.codecov.yml`, `sonar-project.properties`, `.gitleaks.toml`, etc.) to exclude the consolidated build output from scans.
*   üé® [style] Reformats the `.gitleaks.toml` configuration file by sorting keywords and paths alphabetically for improved readability and consistency.

- üöú [refactor] Standardize build output directory to 'dist'

Unifies the build output path for the Electron main and preload processes from `dist-electron` to a single `dist` directory. This simplifies the build configuration, scripts, and overall project structure.

*   ‚ú® **Build & Configuration (`vite.config.ts`, `package.json`)**
    *   Updates the Vite configuration to direct all build outputs to the `dist` directory, removing the separate `dist-electron` path.
    *   Modifies the `main` entry in `package.json` to point to `dist/main.js`.
    *   Adjusts various npm scripts (`clean`, `copy-wasm`, `electron-main:debug`) to use the new `dist` path.

*   üõ†Ô∏è **Source Code (`WindowService.ts`)**
    *   Updates the `getPreloadPath` method to resolve the preload script from the `dist` directory during development.

*   üë∑ **CI/CD (`flatpak-build.yml`)**
    *   Modifies the Flatpak build workflow to cache, check for, and package artifacts from the `dist` directory.

*   üß™ **Testing & Debugging (`.vscode/launch.json`, `playwright/fixtures/global-setup.ts`)**
    *   Aligns VS Code launch configurations to debug the main process from `dist/main.js`.
    *   Updates the Playwright global setup to verify the main process file exists in the correct `dist` location.

*   üìù **Documentation (`docs/`)**
    *   Updates all guides (environment setup, troubleshooting, testing) and code examples to reflect the new `dist` output directory.

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Centralize monitor interval constants and logic

This commit refactors monitor interval handling to improve consistency, robustness, and performance across the application.

*   ‚ú® [feat] Introduces a new shared module `shared/constants/monitoring.ts` to act as a single source of truth for:
    *   `DEFAULT_MONITOR_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (5 minutes)
    *   `MIN_MONITOR_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (5 seconds)
    *   A new utility function `shouldRemediateMonitorInterval` to centralize the logic for determining if an interval is invalid (e.g., `null`, `NaN`, or below the minimum).

*   üöú [refactor] Updates multiple parts of the codebase to use these new shared constants and logic:
    *   The minimum interval validation in Zod schemas and the `ConfigurationManager` now use `MIN_MONITOR_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`.
    *   The logic for applying default intervals in `MonitorManager` and `MonitorValidator` is now delegated to the `shouldRemediateMonitorInterval` function, making it more robust.
    *   Frontend monitor normalization (`normalizeMonitor`) now clamps check intervals to the new shared minimum.

*   ‚ö° [perf] Improves the performance of applying default monitor intervals in `MonitorManager`:
    *   Instead of updating each monitor with an invalid interval individually, all required updates are now batched into a single database transaction.
    *   The in-memory cache is now explicitly updated after remediation to prevent state inconsistencies.

*   üß™ [test] Updates and expands test suites to cover the new logic:
    *   Tests for `MonitorValidator` and `monitorOperations` are updated to reflect the new minimum interval rules and remediation logic.
    *   Tests for `MonitorManager` are enhanced to verify that the cache is correctly updated and that database operations are batched in a transaction.

### ‚ú® Features

- ‚ú® [feat] Improve IPC API contracts and cache invalidation

This commit refactors key Inter-Process Communication (IPC) APIs for better type safety and introduces a cache invalidation mechanism to ensure the UI stays synchronized with backend data changes.

### Source Code Changes

*   **‚ú® [feat] Add Cache Invalidation on Data Import:**
    *   After successfully importing data, the backend now emits a `cache:invalidated` event.
    *   This proactively notifies the renderer process that its data (specifically the site list) is stale and needs to be resynchronized, preventing inconsistent states.

*   **üöú [refactor] Enhance `updateHistoryLimit` API:**
    *   The `updateHistoryLimit` function in the settings API now returns the updated `number` value from the backend instead of `void`.
    *   This provides immediate feedback to the frontend, allowing the UI store to confirm and sanitize the value received from the backend, improving data consistency.

*   **üöú [refactor] Standardize `importData` API Return Type:**
    *   The `importData` function now returns a `Promise<boolean>` instead of a `Promise<string>`.
    *   This simplifies the API contract to a clear success/failure flag, making it easier for the frontend to handle the operation's outcome.

*   **‚ö° [perf] Implement Frontend Cache Syncing:**
    *   A new `cacheSync` utility is introduced in the renderer to listen for `cache:invalidated` events.
    *   When an event is received, it triggers a full resynchronization of the relevant data stores (e.g., `useSitesStore`, `useMonitorTypesStore`), ensuring the UI always reflects the latest backend state.

*   **üìù [docs] Clean Up `WindowService` Documentation:**
    *   Removes corrupted text and clarifies comments in the `WindowService` for better readability.

### Development & Build Changes

*   **üß™ [test] Update Tests for API and Event Changes:**
    *   Unit and comprehensive tests for preload scripts, services, and stores are updated to align with the new API return types and behaviors.
    *   Tests now validate the `boolean` return from `importData` and the `number` return from `updateHistoryLimit`.
    *   A test is added to confirm the `cache:invalidated` event is emitted correctly during data import.
    *   Asynchronous test logic is improved to prevent race conditions.

*   **üîß [build] Refine ESLint and Knip Configurations:**
    *   Removes the `eslint-plugin-boundaries` configuration, which is no longer needed.
    *   Updates the `knip` configuration to correctly identify entry points and dependencies, reducing false positives.

*   **üßπ [chore] Update Dependencies:**
    *   [dependency] Updates versions for numerous development dependencies, including `@typescript-eslint`, `@playwright/test`, and various ESLint plugins.

- üöú [refactor] Consolidate build outputs and enhance IPC stability

This commit introduces several refactoring and stability improvements across the project. Build output directories are consolidated into a centralized `.cache` folder, and IPC event handling is made more robust. Additionally, comprehensive tests are added for renderer-side services.

### Source Code Changes

*   **‚ö° [perf] Improve IPC Event Handling Stability**
    *   Wraps event listener callbacks in the IPC `bridgeFactory` with `try...catch` blocks.
    *   This prevents a single misbehaving event handler from crashing the entire event system for a channel. Errors are now logged as warnings without halting execution. üõ°Ô∏è

### Build and Configuration Changes

*   **üîß [build] Consolidate Build Artifacts**
    *   Relocates all TypeScript build outputs (`dist-*` folders) and `tsBuildInfoFile`s into a unified `.cache/builds/` directory.
    *   This cleans up the project root and simplifies gitignore rules.

*   **üîß [build] Unify Electron and Shared Output**
    *   Changes the output directory for `electron` and `shared` modules from `dist-electron` and `dist-shared` to a single `dist` directory.

*   **üßπ [chore] Refine VS Code Tasks**
    *   Removes numerous outdated or redundant npm script tasks from `tasks.json` to simplify the developer workflow.

*   **üé® [style] Clean Up ESLint Configuration**
    *   Removes several `@ts-expect-error` comments, indicating that underlying type issues in ESLint plugins have been resolved.

### Testing Improvements

*   **üß™ [test] Add Comprehensive Service Tests**
    *   Introduces new comprehensive test suites for `DataService`, `EventsService`, `SettingsService`, and `SystemService`.
    *   These tests ensure high code coverage and validate service initialization, API interactions, error handling, and edge cases.

*   **üß™ [test] Update Preload API Tests for IPC Response Format**
    *   Adapts preload domain API tests (`monitoring`, `settings`, `sites`, etc.) to align with a new standardized IPC response format (`{ success: true, data: ... }`).
    *   This ensures tests accurately reflect the updated data contract between the main and renderer processes.

*   **üß™ [test] Correct IPC Channel Names in Tests**
    *   Fixes incorrect event channel names (e.g., `test:event` to `test-event`) in tests to match the implementation.

- üöú [refactor] Refactor styles to use centralized design system tokens

This commit refactors the application's styling to adopt a more robust and centralized design token system for improved consistency and theming.

*   üé® **Color Variables**: Replaces component-specific or generic color variables with new semantic theme tokens.
    *   `--color-accent` is now `--color-primary-500`.
    *   `--color-border` and `--color-neutral-*` are replaced with semantic alternatives like `--color-border-primary` and `--color-background-secondary`.
    *   Hardcoded `--color-white` for text is replaced with `--color-text-inverse` for better theme adaptability.
*   üñåÔ∏è **Shadows & Effects**: Updates shadow and easing function variables to align with the new design system.
    *   `--color-shadow` is replaced by `--shadow-md`.
    *   A hardcoded box-shadow color is now generated dynamically using `color-mix` with a theme variable.
    *   Transition timing `ease-in-out` is updated to a new standard, `ease-smooth`.
*   üîß **Theme Structure**: Adds a `white` property to the theme color definition and type interface, ensuring its availability across all themes.

### üöú Refactor

- üöú [refactor] Centralize shadow colors into the theme system

This refactoring introduces a new `shadows` object to the theme, centralizing the definition of shadow colors used for status badges and other elements.

*   ‚ú® **Theme System (`themes.ts`, `types.ts`):**
    *   Adds a `shadows` property to the `Theme` type to hold status-specific shadow colors (`degraded`, `error`, `paused`, `success`, `warning`).
    *   Defines these new shadow colors for the `baseTheme`, `darkTheme`, and `highContrastTheme`, allowing for better theming capabilities.

*   üé® **CSS (`Header.css`):**
    *   Updates status badge styles to use the new, systematically named CSS variables for shadows (e.g., `--color-success-shadow` becomes `--color-shadows-success`). This improves readability and maintainability.
    *   Corrects the `.status-degraded-badge` to use its own dedicated `degraded` status colors and shadows instead of reusing the `warning` colors, ensuring visual consistency.

- üöú [refactor] Centralize cache configuration and logger interfaces

This refactoring consolidates shared code by moving cache constants and logger interfaces to the `shared` directory, improving code reuse and consistency between the frontend and backend.

### Source Code Changes

*   **‚ö° [perf] Direct Cache Configuration Usage**
    *   Removes the intermediate `CACHE_TTL` and `CACHE_SIZE_LIMITS` constants from the Electron backend.
    *   The `ConfigurationManager` now directly consumes cache settings (TTL and max size) from the centralized `CACHE_CONFIG` object located in the `shared` directory. This eliminates redundant declarations and centralizes cache management.

*   **üöú [refactor] Unified Logger Interface**
    *   Creates a new shared logger interface file at `@shared/utils/logger/interfaces.ts`, defining `BaseLogger`, `ExtendedLogger`, and other specialized logger types.
    *   The `Logger` type is now a `BaseLogger` for backward compatibility.
    *   All backend files are updated to import the `Logger` type from this new shared location instead of the local `electron/utils/interfaces.ts`.
    *   The frontend logger service is refactored to implement the `UnifiedLogger` interface, ensuring a consistent logging contract across the entire application.
    *   The now-redundant `Logger` interface definition is removed from `electron/utils/interfaces.ts`.

### Test and Documentation Changes

*   **üß™ [test] Update Constant Tests**
    *   Removes tests for the now-deleted `CACHE_TTL` and `CACHE_SIZE_LIMITS` constants.
    *   The test suites are updated to reflect the new state of the backend constants file.

*   **üìù [docs] Update Interface Documentation**
    *   Adds documentation to `electron/utils/interfaces.ts` to guide developers to import logger types from the new shared path.

### üß™ Testing

- üß™ [test] Refactor benchmark tests to use real implementations

This commit overhauls the performance benchmark suite to enhance accuracy and relevance by replacing mock objects with real application components. By testing against the actual `StandardizedCache`, `SiteRepository`, `TypedEventBus`, `Zustand` stores, and monitoring services, the benchmarks now provide a much more realistic measure of the application's performance characteristics.

Key improvements across the benchmark suite include:

*   üß™ **[test]** Replaces mock classes in benchmark tests with the actual application services and data structures. This ensures performance is measured against the production code, not simplified imitations.
*   ‚ö° **[perf]** Introduces more comprehensive and realistic benchmark scenarios, covering a wider range of operations, edge cases, and data sizes (small, medium, large).
*   ‚ú® **[feat]** Adds new benchmarks for features that were not covered by the old mocks, such as cache statistics, event emission, invalidation callbacks, and complex state store interactions.
*   üöú **[refactor]** Updates test data generation to produce more realistic and complex data structures, better simulating real-world usage patterns.
*   üßπ **[chore]** Standardizes the use of `vitest` configuration options like `warmupIterations` and `iterations` to improve the stability and reliability of benchmark results.
*   üìù **[docs]** Updates file-level documentation in each benchmark file to reflect the use of real implementations and the expanded scope of testing.

**Specific Changes by File:**

*   **Cache Benchmarks:**
    *   Removes the `BenchmarkCache` mock in favor of the real `StandardizedCache`.
    *   Adds tests for statistics access (`getStats`), event emission, and invalidation handlers, which are features of the real implementation.

*   **Site Repository Benchmarks:**
    *   Replaces `MockSiteRepository` with the actual `SiteRepository`, using a mock database service.
    *   Tests are now asynchronous to match the real repository's API.
    *   Adds extensive new tests for `upsert`, `bulkInsert`, `exportAll`, and concurrent operation simulation.

*   **Event Bus Benchmarks:**
    *   Swaps the `MockTypedEventBus` for the real `TypedEventBus`.
    *   Introduces tests for middleware processing and diagnostic introspection (`getDiagnostics`).

*   **State Management & Zustand Benchmarks:**
    *   Replaces a complex, custom mock state manager with tests for real `Zustand` store patterns used in the application (`sites`, `settings`, `ui`).
    *   Adds benchmarks for multi-store interactions, subscriptions, and performance with large datasets.

*   **Monitoring & Alerting Benchmarks:**
    *   Updates the alert system benchmark to use the real `NotificationService`, testing the performance of triggering `up`/`down` alerts.
    *   Refactors the health check engine benchmark to use the real `EnhancedMonitorChecker` with its full dependency tree (mocked at the repository level), providing a holistic performance view.

üöú [refactor] Improves type safety and robustness in several areas.
 - Introduces a type guard in `stateSyncApi.ts` to validate incoming `StateSyncEventData` before processing, preventing potential runtime errors from malformed event data.
 - Simplifies the `waitForElectronAPI` utility by removing unnecessary optional chaining, making the check for API availability more direct.
 - Replaces `createTypedInvoker` with `createVoidInvoker` in `settingsApi.ts` for operations that do not return a value, improving clarity and intent.

üìù [docs] Updates documentation to improve clarity and formatting.
 - Refines the system architecture documentation with better formatting and a more concise conclusion.
 - Improves the readability of the IPC channel analysis report by adding spacing and consistent formatting.

üé® [style] Applies minor code style and formatting adjustments across multiple files for consistency and readability.

üß™ [test] Updates tests to align with source code changes and improve coverage.
 - Adjusts mocks and assertions in unit and integration tests to reflect the refactored logic, particularly for API calls and store behavior.
 - Corrects test assertions from `toHaveBeenCalledOnce()` to `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` for consistency.
