# Security Audit Resolution - Issue #33

## Summary

This document outlines the resolution of npm audit vulnerabilities identified in Issue #33.

## Original Issue

The issue reported high-severity vulnerabilities in `@eslint/plugin-kit` <0.3.3 affecting `eslint-plugin-unicorn` >=58.0.0.

## Resolution Status

### ✅ Resolved Vulnerabilities

1. **@eslint/plugin-kit vulnerability** (GHSA-xffm-g5w8-qvg7)
   - **Status**: Already resolved
   - **Current version**: 0.3.5 (above vulnerable version 0.3.3)
   - **Action**: No action needed - vulnerability was already fixed

2. **@types/postcss-normalize vulnerability**
   - **Status**: Resolved by removal
   - **Action**: Removed unused package from dependencies
   - **Impact**: No functional impact - package was not used in codebase

3. **tmp package vulnerability** (GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6)
   - **Status**: Resolved by removal
   - **Action**: Removed unused @commitlint/prompt and @commitlint/prompt-cli packages
   - **Impact**: No functional impact - packages were not used in npm scripts
   - **Vulnerability count reduced**: 6 vulnerabilities eliminated

### ⚠️ Remaining Vulnerability

1. **postcss vulnerability** (GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j)
   - **Package**: postcss <8.4.31 in postcss-viewport-height-correction
   - **Severity**: Moderate
   - **Status**: No fix available (as of audit date)
   - **Impact**: PostCSS line return parsing error (CWE-74, CWE-144)
   - **Risk Assessment**: 
     - Build-time only vulnerability
     - Required for Electron viewport height correction
     - Low production runtime risk
   - **Mitigation**: Package is essential for proper Electron app viewport handling

## Changes Made

### Removed Dependencies
- `@types/postcss-normalize` - Unused TypeScript types
- `@commitlint/prompt` - Unused commit prompt tool
- `@commitlint/prompt-cli` - Unused commit prompt CLI

### Updated Configuration
- Updated `knip.json` to remove references to removed packages

### Verification
- ✅ Build process verified working
- ✅ Test suite verified working
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced

## Vulnerability Count Reduction

- **Before**: 8 vulnerabilities (2 high, 3 moderate, 3 low)
- **After**: 1 vulnerability (1 moderate)
- **Reduction**: 87.5% reduction in vulnerabilities

## Risk Assessment

The remaining vulnerability is in a build-time dependency with moderate severity. The security risk to production runtime is minimal as:

1. It affects PostCSS parsing during build time
2. The vulnerable package is essential for proper Electron viewport handling
3. No fix is currently available from the package maintainer

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor for updates**: Regularly check for updates to `postcss-viewport-height-correction`
2. **Alternative solutions**: Consider migrating to CSS-based viewport height solutions if they become available
3. **Ongoing monitoring**: Continue running `npm audit` regularly to catch new vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. Removed unused dependencies that introduced vulnerabilities
2. Verified build and test functionality after changes
3. Documented remaining risks and mitigation strategies
4. Regular dependency monitoring process in place
